    "title": "Factors That Influence Challenges and Opportunities of Cryptocurrencies in Developing Countries",
    "abstract": "Blockchain is a technology that uses structure in storage. One of the products of blockchain technology is cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is an innovation in the fintech field where cryptography-based digital currency can provide various advantages for the community. The problem of cryptocurrencies in developing countries is scalability, security issues, and price volatility. The main advantage with cryptocurrency is low fees and can provide transparency and security of the identity of the owner. This paper is using a systematic literature review on conducting research. The main advantage of this paper is researching the development of blockchain technology that focuses on developing countries where most of the research are conducted for blockchain technology is in developed countries. Cryptocurrencies can help developing countries make various transactions using only smartphones without third parties. However, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge in using cryptocurrencies because there is still no government regulation, high volatility, and security issues.",

    "title": "Trusted digital identity provision: GOV.UK Verify\u2019s federated approach",
    "abstract": "The UK\u2019s recently launched GOV.UK Verify service relies on a novel federated approach for digital identity verification. Accredited private companies are tasked with verifying the identities of individuals to enable them to access various government services and portals. The private identity providers can draw on a number of public and private databases to validate users\u2019 identities to a given level of identity assurance. The paper provides an overview of the GOV.UK Verify approach to identity verification. It describes the government\u2019s motivations for developing such a system; the standards, principles, and governance arrangements that underpin it; and how the identity proofing and verification works in practice. It considers the expansion of the Verify model for other government and private sector uses and discusses the exclusion, privacy, and liability risks associated with the use of the system. Finally, the paper highlights important lessons for other countries seeking to develop similar systems for digital access.",

    "title": "Paradoxes of Intermediation in Aadhaar: Human Making of a Digital Infrastructure",
    "abstract": "Abstract E-governance projects in India are often purported to minimise the role of human intermediaries. They rely on machines to curtail corruption and bring more efficiency to service delivery. However, studies have found human intermediation and its affordances to be crucial, especially in developing countries where social endowment gaps pose considerable barriers to the effective use of information and communication technologies. Human intermediation in technological infrastructure is thus invisible yet inevitable. I unravel this paradox of intermediation by examining the everyday practices of two sets of intermediaries in Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan associated with everyday workings of Aadhaar, India\u2019s digital biometric identity infrastructure. Looking at biometric technologies as \u2018situated practice\u2019, I draw on the notion of \u2018infrastructuring\u2019 to argue that the discretionary practices of human intermediaries in fact stabilise the technological system, anchoring it to a human infrastructure. So, as disruptive technologies such as Aadhaar are implemented, their effective usage will invariably rely on the potential agency of human intermediaries and their collaborative work practices.",

    "title": "Blockchain-Based Sensitive Document Storage to Mitigate Corruptions",
    "abstract": "Currently, all document processes in developing countries require third-party (human) verification; this makes said documents susceptible to human error. Blockchain technology makes the need for a central authority redundant as the devices needing to download digital assets are connected to one another via a peer-to-peer network. It allows for the exchange and storage of digital assets without the need for third-party oversight. The main objective of this article is to develop a blockchain solution in an attempt to mitigate corruption. The contribution details a document verification process as a solution to lessen third-party access to sensitive information and ensure that it is safe and untampered with. The solution proposed to this issue was the introduction of blockchain technology to aid in document verification. This makes the entire system decentralized and reduces the amount of third-party access to sensitive information. Using blockchain makes documents immutable thus reducing corrupt activity such as identity theft and ghost accounts. A blockchain implementation in the field of document verification also dissolves the need for certified copies, which then allows for better use of state funds and public service workers. This work can prove to be a major enabler to achieve sustainable development goal-16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).",

    "abstract": "\n The media space is the most dynamic and rapidly developing not only technological, but also economic, cultural, social and political phenomenon of our time, and new communication channels are being formed in the global digital network. The purpose of the article is to analyze new media as a subject of the political process. The subject is new media, and the object is the cultural and political identification of an individual in new media. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that new media are an innovative and extremely important tool in determining cultural and political identity. Countries belong to the same civilization, which means that their culture is based on identical values \u2013 this is of fundamental importance, since the effectiveness of the imposed system of values and norms can be realized in a particular country only if the tasks being disseminated are consonant with the values of society. Conceptual, phenomenological and sociolinguistic analysis, the method of system analysis, and the historical and cultural method were used as methods and approaches.\u00a0 As a result of a comprehensive analysis, the following conclusions were drawn: the disseminated values can be effective only if they are in tune with the civilizational model of the region, and on the contrary, the imposed foundations will not effectively affect society if they contradict its civilizational identification and cultural and political affiliation. The actions of an individual and society as a whole are determined by his self-identification, therefore, a political course can be effective in a particular country if the tasks being implemented are consonant with the values of society. This study may be useful for researchers studying communication in the digital environment, the impact of new media on the agenda, the realization of political goals through online media, as well as for international journalists, diplomats, political scientists and media researchers when writing analytical materials on topics related to the working concepts of the current study.\n",

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of today's society, digital image processing technology has been applied in more and more fields, among which authentication in digital image processing technology has become a hot field. In the process of identity verification, the face is used as the basis of feature recognition because the method of using the face as a feature basis is more easily accepted by the public and the operation is simple and the feasibility is stronger. In the online education model, observing and comparing students' facial emotions through the platform and analyzing students' learning goals, learning effects, learning emotions, and contradictions and conflicts arising in the process of cooperation have become an effective teaching evaluation system. Up to now, China has developed into the second largest economy in the world. The global \u201cChinese fever\u201d has brought China's culture into a new stage of development. Countries in the world learn Chinese culture by developing Chinese language courses. By building a Chinese learning intelligent system with a B/S structure, this system can effectively evaluate the teaching process. It can be seen from the test results that the platform meets the basic requirements of functional design.",

    "title": "Federated e-Identity Management Across the Gulf Cooperation Council",
    "abstract": "The concept of federated e-identity is gaining attention worldwide in light of evolving identity management challenges to streamlining access control and providing quality and convenient online services. In a federated system, participating institutions share identity attributes based on agreed-upon standards, facilitating authentication from other members of the federation and granting appropriate access to online resources. The article provides insight into the ongoing federated e-Identity initiative in GCC countries. The aim of the initiative is to develop a trusted and secure cross-border infrastructure to authenticate and validate citizens' identities across GCC borders. Such an interoperability platform then can be used to facilitate citizens' mobility and stand as the basis for digital economy development. Current literature does not include any information about the work going on in GCC countries in relation to the GCC eID platform. This article thus contributes to developing a better understanding of such practices, triggers debate and discussion, opens the door to reflection, and guides international efforts in this eminent domain of practice.",

    "title": "Raspberry Pi voting system, a reliable technology for transparency in democracy",
    "abstract": "Voting process takes the significant part of democratic systems. In most of the developing countries, paper ballot method is still being used. Information technology also has offered significant advantages and facilities to improve the quality of voting process. Digital recording electronic systems are developed replacing paper ballots. Although this is a great advancement, this process is prone to tampering threats and electoral frauds. This paper presents a new voting process which makes use of Raspberry Pi which has improved reliability and transparency over currently used systems. This system employs biometric identifiers in pursuit of authenticity. Pre collected details of all the voters in the country will be maintained as a central database by the government. This data is rechecked at the time of voting to ensure the identity of voters. Usage of Raspberry Pi for web casting the complete voting process and time to time display of polling percentage etc., details will tremendously affect the reliability of the process. Transparency and minimum usage of personnel is achieved at a cheaper cost and simpler process with this Raspberry Pi and its peripherals.",

    "abstract": "Increased use of electronic identification (eID) over physical identification is paving the way for adoption of electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems to fulfill customer identification and verification (CIV) obligations. The impact of eKYC can however manifest beyond CIV to other Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes. \n \nSuccessful implementation of eKYC while important for Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) purposes requires more than just a robust eID and affects SIM card registrations and opening of Digital Financial Services (DFS) accounts and hence financial inclusion. \n \nTo highlight this trend, this Note discusses current implementations of eIDs and eKYC and its impact on, access to and provision of DFS. However, with multiple stakeholders in the system, issues of regulatory coordination, technological capacity, and data protection and privacy affect the use of eKYC for financial inclusion. \n \nThe eKYC systems that have been launched have as their overriding goals to advance a person\u2019s access to services, reduce identity fraud, and increase financial inclusion. Country examples and challenges \u2013 public policy, privacy, harmonization, security, legal, financial and infrastructural - in the rollout are discussed.",

    "title": "Many Eyed Monsters and Their Lure: Surveillance, Seduction, and Governmentality",
    "abstract": "Large scale digital systems employed for national population management regularly invoke narrative of surveillance risk especially of the \u2018big brother\u2019 kind. This has been true of India\u2019s biometric digital identity program and China\u2019s social credit system, both of which aim for universal national coverage and the financial inclusion of large underserved population. This paper analyses both these cases beyond the view of top-down panoptic state surveillance to use \u2018liquid surveillance\u2019 as a lens. By analyzing policy and media discourses multiple aspects of a complex surveillant power emerges. Efforts of inclusion as a practice of the state\u2019s neoliberal governmentality is seen to cast individuals as a citizen-consumer hybrid. Power is then experienced by the surveilled individuals as combination of consumerist seduction of the market and surveillant control by the state. This is supplemented by traditional synoptic media messaging and, newer, more atypical surveillance mechanisms as peer-topeer surveillance is routinised in social interactions by the prevalent and necessary use of the surveillant technology in question.",

    "abstract": "The financial SHG are an important identity in the Indian rural financial sector; their role in mobilizing funds in rural sector cannot be ignored in the objective of Financial Inclusion of Indian Economic System. The historical date in the Indian Economy, 8th November 2016, The \"D\" movement i.e. Demonetization has compelled the adoption of other \"D\" in the financial sector of the Indian Economy i.e. Digitization of the Banking and Financial Systems. Post demonetization, digital economy is the fore requisite for successful working of the financial system in India. Digitalization of banks has compelled imparting of vocational training and financial literacy to these villagers so that they may use the banking system to their optimum efficiency. This research paper is an attempt to highlight the importance of imparting vocational training and financial literacy as the pre requisite for digitization of SHGs in India. The study concludes that financial literacy and vocational training may not be the only requirement for the process of digitization of SHG, but, the blend of these two elements in the overall process of financial inclusion would definitely increase the rate of successful digitization of SHGs in India.\"",

    "abstract": "Identification is necessary for sustainable development. It is an enabler for (among others) the right to vote, financial inclusion, gender equality and health services, and a key element in empowerment. Recognizing the opportunities presented by advances in digital and biometric technology, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) requested an assessment and feasibility study regarding the potential for a national identification system(s) to underpin transparent voter lists for future elections and for sustainable development applications. A study team comprised of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Terra Incognita (TI), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank (WB) carried out the assessment during the period from July to November 2016 in response to the FGS request and to support the FGS in considering options for identification systems and making strategic decisions regarding the development of a robust identity ecosystem in the country. The study team consulted multiple stakeholders and drew on local knowledge, as well as lessons from other countries, including India, Pakistan, Peru, and others. This joint approach to carrying out an assessment of identity management is a first within the global context. Establishing a legal identification system, particularly one that is digital, could be a game changer for the FGS\u2019s capacity to administer a variety of public programs and services (including election administration), for the growth of the Somali economy and banking sector, and for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and other support by the international community. However, the challenges in rolling out an inclusive, robust, and safe system are immense.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the potential of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), with a focus on blockchain, to address key challenges related to the security, ownership, and management of personal data. We trace the foundational work of Haber and Stornetta, who introduced the core principles of blockchain to secure digital records within the real economy. Building on this, Nakamoto\u2019s innovations in blockchain technology introduced a native crypto-asset, which not only aligns and concentrates the interests of network participants but also resolves the previously unsolved \u201cdouble-spending problem.\u201d This breakthrough decentralizes the verification and control of recorded information, enhancing security in monetary transactions.Migrants often face challenges related to rights protection, identity management, and limited access to financial services. Blockchain applications, with their strengths in secure data storage, transparent transactions, and reliable identity verification, offer promising solutions. In this article, we examine real-world blockchain applications that enhance identity management and foster financial inclusion for migrants. Blockchain provides an infrastructure that empowers individuals with greater control over their financial and personal data, particularly through self-sovereign identity (SSI) and the use of stablecoins as global currencies. These innovations are becoming foundational components of a new digital ecosystem for information and finance.",

    "title": "Property and Privacy: European Perspectives and the Commodification of Our Identity",
    "abstract": "This contribution analyzes the appeal, benefits and limitations of a highly market-oriented argument suggested to resolve the current problems of personal data protection in our digital world: vesting a property right in personal data. Many of the arguments that have been forwarded in favor of such a proprietary perspective derive from American sources. There has been relatively little discussion in Europe of whether such an approach could resolve the pressing problems of personal data protection - a fact that is not entirely surprising, given the European human rights-oriented approach to privacy protection. This contribution aims to add European perspectives to the debate. It will show that although it is all too often argued that the creation of a property right is not in line with the human rights-based approach to privacy, the European system appears to offer considerable leeway and even openings for a property rights model. But the analysis will also show that although the property approach may have some appeal, albeit for rhetorical purposes, doubts rise about whether it will offer the claimed prospects of achieving a higher level of personal data protection. Specifically, the final intent of this contribution is to show that the property argument fails to recognize the data protection challenges that arise with present-day developments in the area of context-aware computing. In a society in which our behavior and identities (i.e. not individual data as such), become the object of commodification, the debate on data protection mechanisms must be structured along lines of control and visibility, rather than ownership. This then will require a debate on the role of the public domain in providing the necessary instruments that will allow us to know and to control how our behavior, interests and social and cultural identities are 'created'.",

    "title": "Digital Image Watermarking using BFO Optimized DWT and DCT",
    "abstract": "Watermarking has been invoked as a tool for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of multimedia contents. Because of their digital nature, multimedia documents can be duplicated, modified, transformed, and diffused very easily. In this context, it is important to develop a system for copyright protection, protection against duplication, and authentication of contents. For this, a watermark is embedded into the digital data in such a way that it is indissolubly tied to the data itself. Later on, such watermark can be extracted to prove ownership to trace the dissemination of the marked work through the network, or simply to inform users about the identity of the rights-holder or about the allowed use of data. This paper deals the developing the watermarking schemes for digital images stored in both, spatial and transformed domain. In this thesis we mainly focus on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based development. To increase the undetectability and to increase the claim, gain of embedding algorithm is optimized with the help of bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) so that security is increased. For this every watermark is given a unique identification, same as the principle of Code Division Multiple Accessing (CDMA) technique. To prove its commercial usability, we take special care so that at least one attack, having huge financial implications, can be sustained due to the in-built capacity of the watermarking scheme. Apart from this, since JPEG is the most commonly used image format over WWW, we pay special attention to robustness against noise attack. We propose to increase the robustness against some attacks by pre-processing the images. In this paper, we also present a correlation between the performance of the watermarking scheme against some attacks and the original image characteristics. All presented watermarking schemes are robust against common image manipulations and attacks",

    "abstract": "As the establishment of a new digital economy and industrial ecosystem in the virtual world due to the combination of metaverse and NFT is drawing great attention, uses of NFTs on various metaverse platforms such as games and entertainment are increasing. In particular, as the metaverse era, in which the real world and the virtual world are combined and interacted through realistic technology, is in full swing, interest in NFT, which acts as a digital asset in the metaverse, is expected to increase. NFT is necessary to support the economic system in the virtual world and accordingly, and accordingly legal issues surrounding uses of NFTs in metaverse are also emerging. In particular, it is difficult to track the identity of the seller or buyer of NFT that can be used on the metaverse due to the nature of the blockchain that presupposes anonymity. In addition, the current intellectual property system alone has limitations in protecting intellectual property rights related to various contents created and NFTized on the metaverse. As various intellectual property issues surrounding created and used in Metaverse are being raised, a comprehensive review is needed, such as revising related laws considering the technical characteristics of metaverse, establishing clear interpretation standards in policy support and service provision. In this regards, this article addresses major IPR issues surrounding uses of NFTs in metaverse, focusing on the scope of the protection of contents NFTized and used in metaverse and infringement of IP rights in the metaverse.",

    "title": "A New Blind Identity-Based Signature Scheme",
    "abstract": "Anonymity of consumers is an essential functionality that should be supported in any digital rights management system. Privacy protection is an important aspect for wider acceptance of consumers of DRM systems. The concept of a blind signature is one possible cryptographic solution, yet it has not received much attention in the identity-based setting. In the identity-based setting, the public key of a user is derived from his identity, thus simplifying certificates management process compared to traditional public key cryptosystems. In this paper, a new blind identity-based signature scheme based on bilinear pairings on elliptic curves is presented. The use of bilinear pairings over elliptic curves enables utilizing smaller key sizes, while achieving the same level of security compared to other schemes not utilizing elliptic curves. The correctness of the proposed scheme is validated and the proof of the blindness property is provided. Performance and security related issues are addressed.",

    "title": "A Framework for Secure and Privacy Preserving Health Data Exchange across Health Information Systems using a Digital Identity System",
    "abstract": "The recent e-Governance initiatives in tandem with the National Health Policy of India, aims to offer patient centric, cost effective, evidence based and quality care to all the individuals. To meet the health policy goal, interconnectivity between the Health Information Systems (HIS) of various healthcare establishments is recommended to enable exchange of health records for intents like healthcare service delivery for everyone from anywhere, as well as to provide direct control to a patient on their health records. The need for global identity, identity verification, patient's consent collection and validation were identified for seamless integration and interoperability of various HIS in the distributed setting. An Identity System creates a unique identity for an individual and manages their Personally Identifiable Information to electronically establish and declare their identity. We believe that the integration of HIS with a Digital Identity System would address key security and privacy concerns for health data exchange in an online environment. The objective of this paper is to first identify the key interactions in a HIS that require authenticated patient identity to ensure privacy-aware and secure access to health data, and to then explore the design of a modular framework that enables these interactions through extensible and efficient integration with an Identity System. In this paper we have proposed a framework that has Unique Identity, Consent Management, Privacy Aware Access Control, Patient Control, Orchestration Layer and Activity Monitoring as main components. These components directly or transitively leverage on patient demographics (eKYC) and Authentication services offered by the Identity System. The extensible framework proposed in this paper, aims to enable secure and privacy preserving health data exchange for provisioning of healthcare services by healthcare establishments, and healthcare analytics by external entities. A production ready prototype has been developed to demonstrate the functionalities of this framework by integrating the Karnataka Mental Healthcare Management System (MHMS or eManas) with MOSIP, the Modular Open Source Identity Platform.",

    "title": "Health Passport: A blockchain-based PHR-integrated self-sovereign identity system",
    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was necessary to validate a person\u2019s health status along with their identity to permit travel. This was facilitated via paper-based certificates and centralized digital apps. Even after COVID-19, it is anticipated that such health status verifications will be required for travel and other purposes. As a result, there needs to be an additional credential, a \u201cHealth Passport,\u201d that establishes whether a person satisfies the health requirements for various purposes. Digital credentials so prepared should be trustable, unforgeable, and verifiable. The Health Passport should be designed to protect the end-users\u2019 privacy and give people control over the data they use to confirm their credentials. This article explores the requirements for a generalized Health Passport system and uses agent-oriented modeling (AOM) to design a blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) system integrated with the Personal Health Record (PHR) to address this requirement. The article demonstrates the feasibility of the solution by implementing a proof of concept on Hyperledger Indy and Aries, integrated with the PHR \u2013 MediTrans. Credential issuance and verification time were calculated, and it was observed that the time overhead was minimal. This solution allows users to verify their credentials with the verifier without revealing any significant personal information. Our solution can be integrated into any PHR solution as the SSI solution is added as a plugin to the PHR accessible via a mobile/web app.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of Digital Health brings increasing data privacy and security challenges, mainly due to data collection by service providers and third parties. The decentralized approach of Self-Sovereign Identity emerges as a solution, offering users direct control over their data. This paper proposes the SmartMed system for controlling access to private medical data by attribute-based access control implemented on smart contracts. The paper investigates the performance limitations of the Ethereum and Besu blockchain platforms in controlling access to medical data. The proposal develops smart contracts to perform attribute-based access control and to store log records in the blockchain, highlighting the detailed performance analysis on both tested platforms. The results reveal the superiority of the Besu platform over Ethereum, indicating a lower computational cost per transaction. Our proposal innovates by proposing a system based on smart contracts to guarantee the authenticity of medical data, complemented by the use of Keycloak in managing access to healthcare systems.",

    "title": "Blockchain Based Cloud Authentication Framework for Digital Identity Management in Smart City",
    "abstract": "The smart city environment includes dozens or even hundreds of various services in various areas of interest to users and aimed at improving the standard of living. These include services related to very sensitive aspects such as health, education, banking, and services that have a secret aspect. Cloud service providers need user data in order to be able to authenticate him in order to be able to access and access the desired service. Therefore, confidentiality, privacy and security are essential conditions for this type of communication. This type of complex and intrusive services leads to the need to provide effective solutions and mechanisms for authentication processes based on digital identity information. The process of building and managing trust between service providers and users needs a system of standards, so this paper provides a framework based on the archived behavior of users and cloud service providers operating within the approved trust circle in a smart environment based on the blockchain and its advantages in reliability, transparency and decentralization, while providing a mathematical model for evaluating and calculating trust standards for all subscribers as a basis for completing the authentication process and accessing services.",

    "title": "IDRes: Identity-Based Respiration Monitoring System for Digital Twins Enabled Healthcare",
    "abstract": "Currently, powerful and ubiquitous mobile devices provide an opportunity to map physical conditions to cyberspace and realize Digital Twins enabled Healthcare (DTeH). Especially, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic renders it necessary to keep an eye on the changing trend of respiration. Long-term respiration monitoring helps to assess personal health status and thus becomes an important issue in DTeH. However, previous mobile device-assistant methods mostly implement the monitoring via short-time detection in a best-effort way and with less consideration of identity recognition, the only mean to bind physical vital signs into personal profiles in digital twins space. Thus, it is necessary to introduce the identification to complete string multiple short-time detections and form long-term personal monitoring. To this end, we propose IDRes, an identity-based respiration monitoring system for DTeH. This system employs mobile devices to generate a high-frequency sonar signal to complete respiration detection and identity recognition. As well as it also estimates the respiration rate by tracking the phase change of the sonar signal and recognizes identity via the Doppler frequency shift of the signal to capture characteristics of chest movement. Moreover, via band-pass filtering to remove the low-frequency voice component of the received signals, the usage of the high-frequency sonar signal also enhances security at the physical level. At last, we conduct a series of experiments under different conditions. Experimental results illustrate that IDRes achieves the mean detection error of 0.49bpm with over 93.3% recognition accuracy, and manifest that IDRes can satisfy the requirements of mapping the accurate vital sign data to the personal profile of DTeH.",

    "abstract": "Digitalization has occurred in almost all industries, one of them is health industry. Patients\u201d medical records are now easier to be accessed and managed as all related data are stored in data storages or repositories. However, this system is still under development as number of patients still increasing. Lack of standardization might lead to patients losing their right to control their own data. Therefore, implementing private blockchain system with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept for identity management in health industry is a viable notion. With SSI, the patients will be benefited from having control over their own medical records and stored with higher security protocol. While healthcare providers will benefit in Know You Customer (KYC) process, if they handle new patients, who move from other healthcare providers. It will eliminate and shorten the process of updating patients' medical records from previous healthcare providers. Therefore, we suggest several flows in implementing blockchain for digital identity in healthcare industry to help overcome lack of patient's data control and KYC in current system. Nevertheless, implementing blockchain on health industry requires full attention from surrounding system and stakeholders to be realized.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) have become the new standard in the healthcare industry, but they have certain disadvantages as well, such as data breaches, data silos, and ownership issues. Blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain, offers the potential to resolve these issues by building a decentralized and secure network for the storing and exchanging of health data. This study explores the benefits and drawbacks of using an NFT-based health identification and a decentralized system for storing health records on the Ethereum blockchain. Understanding how these technologies might be applied to build a safe and open system for exchanging and storing health data, is crucial for enhancing the standard of care. In this paper, we propose an open protocol for consent to access the health records of the user using the blockchain network. This consent needs to be given by the user, and no hindrance will be faces while retrieving the medical records of the patient. The study also emphasizes the requirement for a uniform framework in India to enable digital health infrastructure in a safe, decentralized way, with benefits including user consent, portability across national boundaries and ease of access.",

    "abstract": "The typical method of keeping track of medical records uses paper and centralised systems, which introduces a great deal of uncertainty and can lead to inaccurate information, identity theft, a lack of accessibility, and other problems. With the use of blockchain technology, which offers us security, availability, and integrity, this study seeks to address these problems. Using this, the records can be safeguarded and accessible from anywhere, at any time. This blockchain-based solution can protect a patient's life in an emergency since all of the records can be viewed in one location without the inconvenience of running various tests. Re-chain a secure blockchain-based digital medical health record management system was developed to solve the problems with the centralized and traditional system. It is based on the Ethereum network and uses web3.storage which is an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) system to store files in a decentralized manner.",

    "title": "The Double Burden: The Digital Exclusion and Identity Crisis of Elderly Patients in Rural China",
    "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of China\u2019s healthcare system, a phenomenon that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, had two negative consequences for a significant portion of elderly persons in China. The first is an unfortunate practical outcome: their exclusion from many health services such as online medical appointment platforms, e-prescription requests, obtaining e-referrals, and sharing electronic medical records. The second is an emotionally debilitating identity crisis as elderly persons\u2019 former status as knowledgeable senior mentors was replaced with social perceptions of them as helpless and ignorant souls reliant on more youthful persons for guidance and assistance. This article adopts a grounded theory to explore the phenomenon from the perception of excluded elderly persons using participatory observation and in-depth interviews of 44 elderly clients of a rural hospital in the Shandong province in eastern China. The study shows that the current focus on direct practical aspects of digital exclusion may fail to capture the impact and ancillary consequences such as a painful loss of self-esteem by the digitally excluded. As the study illustrates, the practical aspects can all be overcome through intervention by those who aid the digitally excluded but this help may exacerbate the rarely considered ancillary harms of digital exclusion. Studies of digital exclusion will make more significant contributions to our understanding of the phenomenon if they look beyond the obvious direct consequences of digital exclusion to consider possible ancillary and flow-on effects.",

    "abstract": "People of all ages need a variety of vaccines to avoid spreading preventable diseases. For future reference and analysis, vaccination information must be stored maintaining proper security in a Vaccination Data Management (VDM) system. In this paper, a secured data preserving framework is proposed using the Self-Sovereign Identity Management (SSIM), Hyperledger Fabric and Zero Trust Model (ZTM). SSIM is used for sharing secured data following authentication, integrity verification and control using digital identity. Besides, a proof-of-concept is added using Hyperledger Fabric platform as a permissioned blockchain which operates on a distributed network and can only be accessed by valid users. ZTM features are incorporated with this proposed model to enhance security better than the other existing data securing frameworks.",

    "title": "Blockchain-based Decentralised Management of Digital Passports of Health (DPoH) for Vaccination Records",
    "abstract": "\u2014With the recent impact of viral infections and pandemics \u2013 akin to a recent global healthcare emergency due to COVID-19 - there is an urgent need for mass-scale testing and vaccination initiatives for tackling the health and economic crises. However, the centralized storage of patient information has given rise to significant concerns regarding privacy, transparency, and efficient transmission of vaccination records. This paper exploits a blockchain-based solution that presents a novel approach by seamlessly integrating identity verification, encryption protocols, and decentralized storage via IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) which gives rise to the concept of Digital Passport of Health (DPoH). The proposed solution in this paper introduces the concept of DPoH, specifically designed for test certification, and leverages the power of smart contracts on Ethereum-based blockchain technology for securely creating, managing and transmitting data in the form of DPoH. The proposed solution is being evaluated in three dimensions including (i) gas cost (i.e. energy efficiency), (ii) data storage (i.e. storage efficiency), and (iii) data access (i.e. response time) for creation and transmission of DHoPs. The developed solution and its criteria-based validation are complemented with algorithmic implementations that can progress existing research and development on blockchain-based management of health-critical systems.",

This paper describes a new digital Yellow Card, deployable on most regular mobile phones, in which public key certificates represent vaccinations and other credentials, vouched for by officials or field workers. The design has practical benefits for the digital engagement and privacy of low doc persons. It also shows how traditionally hierarchical public key infrastructure can be deployed without dictating identification protocols to communities, thus avoiding some of the controversies that plague this technology. The PKI security function can remain centralized while certificate issuance is decentralized, which leaves community organizations free to carry on their business as usual.",

    "title": "Aadhaar in a Box? Legitimizing Digital Identity in Times of Crisis",
    "abstract": "The political drive to develop digital identity systems, in particular in the Global South with financial and technical support provided by international development actors, is accelerating during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are different reasons for this redoubling of attention to digitizing identities. These include an increased emphasis on digital social protection during the pandemic and the emergence of proposals for digital vaccination/immunity certificates to facilitate the reopening of societies and restoration of economies, which it is argued would need to be supported by robust digital identity infrastructures. Without evaluating the merits of claims about the capacity of digital identity systems to address the various challenges posed by COVID-19, in this paper I instead make a theoretical observation before raising a policy concern. First, I draw attention to the rise of India\u2019s Aadhaar as an exemplar of developmental digital identity, which has intensified during the pandemic, and what this might mean for concepts of surveillance. I then conclude with a call to the development community to take more seriously investments in data protection regulatory capacity in countries where they are supporting digital identity projects.",

    "title": "A Digital Vaccination Pass Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources: A Proof of Concept",
    "abstract": "The traditional manual recording of vaccination records in Germany faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the introduction of a COVID smartphone app with QR codes. However, this solution brought new challenges, emphasizing the need for a centrally managed European digital vaccination record for efficiency and validity. This study assesses the feasibility of using the HL7 FHIR standard in the healthcare industry for implementing a digital vaccination pass management and monitoring system. The system aims to offer convenience and improved efficiency for both patients and healthcare providers while promoting interoperability with other healthcare systems. To this end, we developed a prototype using modern technologies, such as React, Quarkus, and Keycloak. Results indicate potential benefits for patients and healthcare providers, offering access to immunization records, personalized recommendations, and streamlined management. However, integrating nuanced vaccination processes into the standardized FHIR system requires custom extensions, which might hinder interoperability. Manual data entry and the integration of an identity provider present further obstacles in industry scenarios. Despite these challenges, this study suggests that implementing HL7 FHIR can enhance efficiency, data accessibility, and accuracy in the vaccination process, supporting broader digitization efforts in the German healthcare system and beyond.",

    "title": "Blockchain in Healthcare: A Decentralized Platform for Digital Health Passport of COVID-19 Based on Vaccination and Immunity Certificates",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 has become a very transmissible disease that has had a worldwide impact, resulting in a huge number of infections and fatalities. Testing is critical to the pandemic\u2019s successful response because it helps detect illnesses and so attenuate (isolate/cure) them and now vaccination is a life-safer innovation against the pandemic which helps to make the immunity system stronger and fight against this infection. Patient-sensitive information, on the other hand, is now held in a centralized or third-party storage paradigm, according to COVID-19. One of the most difficult aspects of using a centralized storage strategy is maintaining patient privacy and system transparency. The application of blockchain technology to support health initiatives that can minimize the spread of COVID-19 infections in the context of accessibility of the system and for verification of digital passports. Only by combining blockchain technology with advanced cryptographic algorithms can a secure and privacy-preserving solution to COVID-19 be provided. In this article, we investigate the issue and propose a blockchain-based solution incorporating conscience identity, encryption, and decentralized storage via interplanetary file systems (IPFS). For COVID-19 test takers and vaccination takers, our solution includes digital health passports (DHP) as a certification of test or vaccination. We explain smart contracts constructed and tested with Ethereum to preserve a DHP for test and vaccine takers, allowing for a prompt and trustworthy response from the necessary medical authorities. We use an immutable trustworthy blockchain to minimize medical facility response times, relieve the transmission of incorrect information, and stop the illness from spreading via DHP. We give a detailed explanation of the proposed solution\u2019s system model, development, and assessment in terms of cost and security. Finally, we put the suggested framework to the test by deploying a smart contract prototype on the Ethereum TESTNET network in a Windows environment. The study\u2019s findings revealed that the suggested method is effective and feasible.",

    "title": "Perspectives of digital identity \u2013 the case of online education during the COVID-19 pandemic",
    "abstract": "Abstract Each individual is unique, and the digital identity associated with a person should model and guarantee this uniqueness and the ability to reliably recognize him/her. In this paper, we review the challenges posed by the sudden transfer of a significant part of the social activity in the online realm, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with unforeseen consequences on the educational process in particular. If there was a fairly large spectrum of economic activities that were taking place or were facilitated via a digital medium prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the education system worldwide proved to not have been prepared to provide an effective and consistent response to the going online approach, which was merely a choice, but rather the only embraceable option. In the context of online education, this paper can design a comprehensive and integrated framework for assisting the process of students\u2019 digital identity validation, particularly when attending an examination or any other form of academic evaluation conducted remotely. We also consider the integration of digital identity validation with platforms that offer educational content, knowledge evaluation tests, and other elements to which access must be ensured only for authorized users, based on a strict identity identification process to eliminate those who want to defraud or disrupt the functionality of the system.",

    "title": "Blockchain Based Cloud Authentication Framework for Digital Identity Management in Smart City",
    "abstract": "The smart city environment includes dozens or even hundreds of various services in various areas of interest to users and aimed at improving the standard of living. These include services related to very sensitive aspects such as health, education, banking, and services that have a secret aspect. Cloud service providers need user data in order to be able to authenticate him in order to be able to access and access the desired service. Therefore, confidentiality, privacy and security are essential conditions for this type of communication. This type of complex and intrusive services leads to the need to provide effective solutions and mechanisms for authentication processes based on digital identity information. The process of building and managing trust between service providers and users needs a system of standards, so this paper provides a framework based on the archived behavior of users and cloud service providers operating within the approved trust circle in a smart environment based on the blockchain and its advantages in reliability, transparency and decentralization, while providing a mathematical model for evaluating and calculating trust standards for all subscribers as a basis for completing the authentication process and accessing services.",

    "title": "Design and Implementation of the Digital Education Transaction Subject Two-factor Identity Authentication System Based on Blockchain",
    "abstract": "In recent years, online education service platform has swept the world due to its high quality, openness and variety of education resource, and user registered in online platform has increased dramatically. However, the traditional centralized information storage method based on the third-party may cause problems such as the loss and disclosure of the transaction subject identity data, seriously threatening the legitimate rights and interests of users. Therefore, based on education service theory, this paper applies blockchain technology to identity authentication to design and implement a blockchain-based digital education transaction subject identity authentication system. The system proposed in this study can store identity information in ciphertext form and is jointly verified and maintained by the entire network node, thus it can guarantee the security and reliability of identity data in the digital identity authentication.",

    "title": "E-education 2.0: Students' digital identity and online learning activities",
    "abstract": "In general, the implementation of second generation Web technologies enabled the user to have an active role in creating and sharing online resources on global scale with the ability to self-manage the personal online reputation and create different digital identity in the virtual world. Privacy, responsibility, trust and security are just some of the problems of the new technology. Unlike the implementation of e-learning 1.0 in higher education - which enables students to manage their online identities within the virtual learning environments created at one of the traditional platforms (e.g. learning management system Moodle) - in e-learning 2.0 there is a need for directing the students in the process of online identity self-management. Even though certain technical solutions can be found on the market (e.g. new generation e-learning systems which offer access to numerous Web 2.0 tools), it is considered that the digital identity is the important component of e-learning 2.0 in organizational, pedagogical and social sense. This paper describes an example where online service Google Drive has been used for executing online learning activities, and which preceded the study of student general opinion about digital identity and online reputation in e-learning 2.0.",

    "abstract": "Malaysia is in the process of developing a new identity system to provide citizens and residents with secure and efficient access to digital services. This study aimed to determine the responsiveness of the Malaysian population to new technologies and evaluate their opinions on managing their identity online. The study employed a quantitative research design and collected data through an online questionnaire. A total of 1,014 participants from Malaysia, aged 18 years and above, were included in the study, and the data were analysed using cross-tabulation analysis. The theoretical framework of the study was based on the technology acceptance model, the risk and negative consequences theory of individuals' perceptions, and the organizational trustworthiness theory. The results showed that various demographic characteristics influence individuals' attitudes towards technology adoption and online identity management. Gender, age, ethnicity/race, work status, employment sector, level of education, place of living, household income level, and residence state were all significantly associated with early adoption of emerging technologies, trying out new technologies, and enjoyment of trying out new technologies. Certain demographic factors may also have an impact on people's preferences for specific identity management tools. The study also found significant relationships between various demographic factors and trust levels when it comes to personal data. The study findings have implications for policymakers and practitioners involved in promoting the adoption of new technologies and the management of online identities. The study's findings may assist policymakers in implementing better measures for protecting Malaysians' online identity and privacy. Additionally, the results could also inform future research investigating technology adoption and acceptance among Malaysians.",

    "abstract": "The paper analyses the impact that digital transformation of modern education has upon national identity of society. The significant role that national identity plays in providing social cohesion and stability emphasizes the topicality of the research. The quality of human potential as well as people\u2019s promptitude to face and resist natural and social challenges strongly depends on how effectively educational system functions. Implementation of modern computer technologies that have become an integral part of the educational process leads to modernization and development of education in general. That also results in an increase in quality of students\u2019 training and provides integration of education and scientific research. However, incorporation of such technologies in the educational process entails re-evaluation of the approaches to training and education as well as the analysis of their influence on society and its particular social groups. Thus, examination of education digital transformation and exploration of its social consequences is an up-to-date topic for scientific research. The purpose of the paper is to identify major threats digital transformation in education poses to the process of shaping national identity of society. To achieve the goal authors resorted to various methods: dialectics of social cognition, analysis of philosophical, sociological, pedagogical literature, synthesis and modelling of socio-cultural processes. In the conclusion major threats of education digital transformation and their impact on the national identity are summarized.",

    "abstract": "The extensive use of digital platforms has presented considerable challenges to democracy, particularly in the realms of politics and ideology in Brazil. The emergence of digital echo chambers and the rise of extreme viewpoints pose threats to social cohesion, informed decision-making, and the development of individual identities. This analysis focuses specifically on identity formation, the creation and dissemination of information, emphasizing its repercussions on social identity and cultural diversity. Consequently, the influence of these echo chambers in promoting extremist views in this context is just one facet of the broader ideological, racial, and class polarization facing the nation. To face these challenges, it is imperative to defend critical and reflective education on the role and use of social networks, both in the educational system and in the daily lives of young people and society",

    "title": "Social work education and the recognition of rights in the digital tech age: implications for professional identity",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of digital technology by law enforcement apparatuses raises important social justice implications for existing race- and economic-based disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system. The purpose of the present survey research study is to describe and ascertain statistically significant differences and non-differences between, and predictors of, U.S. social work students regarding their attitudes toward, and intersectional knowledge of, law enforcement, privacy rights, and digital technology. With Human Subjects approval, in Fall 2019, the authors administered a 66-item survey across 150 institutions of higher education in the United States with both a Council on Social Work Education-accredited undergraduate and graduate social work program, including collaboratives, using a stratified, random sampling method (N = 430). Results include that students who do not challenge bigotry on social media are approximately two times more likely to: Endorse law enforcement\u2019s use of technology to assist in the apprehension of persons who merely stand accused of committing a crime; and, lack awareness that facial recognition programs result in false positives for people of color (who are overrepresented in the U.S. criminal justice system). Based on these findings, the authors discuss implications for social work education, making recommendations accordingly.",

    "title": "Digitalization and National Identity of Russian Education",
    "abstract": "The article analyzes the results of the introduction of digitalization and its impact on the identity of modern Russian education and society. The authors consistently review the main milestones of the technologization of the school system \u2013 those activities of the state that were aimed at introducing digitalization into education \u2013 and prove that the introduction of digital technologies into the educational process has actually reduced the quality of learning, and the transition to online formats has led to a decrease in the quality of training, especially in technical fields, where practical training with the use of specialized equipment plays a key role. Opinions of proponents of digitalization are analyzed, their arguments and foresights are considered, which are aimed at a purely technological approach to the human being: not as a unique individual in all the diversity of manifestations of his/her identity, but only as an element of the production process with a given set of strictly limited functions. Objective assessments of the digitalization of education are given, based on research and scientific facts, which allows to conclude that only reliance on traditional values, on the national educational ideal, and not on digital identity can save modern society from the totalitarianism of technology and digital slavery.",

    "title": "Identity in the Digital Age: An Investigation of Malaysian Perspectives on Technology and Privacy",
    "abstract": "Malaysia is in the process of developing a new identity system to provide citizens and residents with secure and efficient access to digital services. This study aimed to determine the responsiveness of the Malaysian population to new technologies and evaluate their opinions on managing their identity online. The study employed a quantitative research design and collected data through an online questionnaire. A total of 1,014 participants from Malaysia, aged 18 years and above, were included in the study, and the data were analysed using cross-tabulation analysis. The theoretical framework of the study was based on the technology acceptance model, the risk and negative consequences theory of individuals' perceptions, and the organizational trustworthiness theory. The results showed that various demographic characteristics influence individuals' attitudes towards technology adoption and online identity management. Gender, age, ethnicity/race, work status, employment sector, level of education, place of living, household income level, and residence state were all significantly associated with early adoption of emerging technologies, trying out new technologies, and enjoyment of trying out new technologies. Certain demographic factors may also have an impact on people's preferences for specific identity management tools. The study also found significant relationships between various demographic factors and trust levels when it comes to personal data. The study findings have implications for policymakers and practitioners involved in promoting the adoption of new technologies and the management of online identities. The study's findings may assist policymakers in implementing better measures for protecting Malaysians' online identity and privacy. Additionally, the results could also inform future research investigating technology adoption and acceptance among Malaysians.",

    "title": "\u201cI want to be a bridge\u201d? The digital identity positioning of transnational bloggers on Chinese social media platforms: Between ethnic differences and cultural affinities",
    "abstract": "How do transnational bloggers position their digital identities on Chinese social media platforms? To answer this question, this study builds a coordinate system of digital identity positioning with intensity of ethnic differences and cultural affinities as the horizontal and vertical coordinates. Four digital identities are found: culturalists, individualists, cultural otherness, and cultural admirers. Transnational bloggers may have overlapping or changing digital identities rather than a single, defined identity. This reflects the process and multiplicity of identity formation, which involves negotiation and flow between ethnic differences and cultural affinities. This study traces transnational bloggers in local digital cultural spaces, raises awareness about the types of split identities in the digital age, and provides an analytical framework for digital identities. Considering the transformation of digital society, researchers should continue to investigate new forms of digital identity building in global and local digital cultural spaces: linking actions, ideologies, and experiences in Internet spaces to broader social, cultural, and political contexts.",

    "title": "The Brand as a Place. For a Model Interpreting Identity in the Digital Age.",
    "abstract": "What if the brand is a place? In specialist literature, the brand interacts through a series of tangible and intangible touchpoints with its interlocutors. When we buy items, use services, or come into contact with any expression of a brand, we come into contact with its being. Whether these are points of sale, events, websites, packaging and products, touchpoints help the interlocutor enter the world of the brand and experience it. These elements play an essential role in building a long-term engagement with it. However, in an ever-changing environment where brands must be flexible and agile to remain market relevant, they must also be able to adapt their behaviours and modulate their identity and expressions based on conditions and context. It is, therefore, necessary to underline the transition from touchpoints to touchplaces in the system of relations between the brand and the audience. The concept of place, as that of the brand, contemplates spirit, personality, and character. Like each place, each brand has its own particular identity and moral character, making both emotional and relational hubs. An interpretation model will allow highlighting this evolution from touchpoints to touchplaces and how these places of exchange and meeting are key elements in offering relevant experiences to the interlocutors.",

    "title": "Identity in the Digital Age: A Review of Information Technology Identity (ITID) Research in Information Systems",
    "abstract": "We live in a world of digital ubiquity, where use of information technologies (IT) has permeated every single aspect of our daily life. Carter and Grover (2015) introduced IT identity (ITID) as a measurable construct into IS literature to explain this intertwinement. Since then, it has provided a theoretical foundation for behavioral research in various contexts in IS and other disciplines as well. To reach a better understanding of this emerging phenomenon of interest and the current state of knowledge, this paper aims to review and analyze the increasing literature on ITID concerning its antecedents and consequences in its nomological network. As the first literature review on ITID construct in IS research, this paper contributes to the overall understanding of ITID in order to demonstrate the importance of ITID in a wide range of behavioral IS topics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of digital technology by law enforcement apparatuses raises important social justice implications for existing race- and economic-based disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system. The purpose of the present survey research study is to describe and ascertain statistically significant differences and non-differences between, and predictors of, U.S. social work students regarding their attitudes toward, and intersectional knowledge of, law enforcement, privacy rights, and digital technology. With Human Subjects approval, in Fall 2019, the authors administered a 66-item survey across 150 institutions of higher education in the United States with both a Council on Social Work Education-accredited undergraduate and graduate social work program, including collaboratives, using a stratified, random sampling method (N = 430). Results include that students who do not challenge bigotry on social media are approximately two times more likely to: Endorse law enforcement\u2019s use of technology to assist in the apprehension of persons who merely stand accused of committing a crime; and, lack awareness that facial recognition programs result in false positives for people of color (who are overrepresented in the U.S. criminal justice system). Based on these findings, the authors discuss implications for social work education, making recommendations accordingly.",

    "title": "Orchestrating Digital Wallets for On- and Off-Chain Decentralized Identity Management",
    "abstract": "Digital identity is becoming one of the core elements during the digitalization age, when more and more processes and interactions are taking place in the digital sphere. Therefore, current identity management approaches will define how these interactions will look in the future, but different fields and communities often approach management with their own solutions and tools, despite their similarities. This includes decentralized digital identities, where the identity is managed with asymmetric cryptographic keys, and no centralized entity oversees the whole identity system. This paper focuses on managing on- and off-chain decentralized digital identities, with the former being used for blockchain networks and the latter for self-sovereignty and privacy. While both types of decentralized identity build on the same cryptographic and identity primitives, there is no single wallet that handles both. Therefore, this paper proposes an orchestration solution for both wallet types, which enables their convergence to a single universal wallet and validates it with a real-life decentralized identity use case.",

    "title": "Pedagogical conditions for instilling national values to younger schoolchildren in the digital age",
    "abstract": "The relevance of this study is determined by the necessity of developing of different types of identity, including national, in modern primary school students, which is impossible without the acceptance of certain values pertinent to a certain people. The purpose of this study is to determine the pedagogical conditions necessary for the development of an axiological system among younger schoolchildren that carries the values of the national environment. During this study, methods of analysis, synthesis, induction, incomplete deduction, incomplete statistical observation, conversations and interviews, as well as a descriptive method were used. The conducted research has shown that several diverse factors influence the successful inculcation of national-patriotic values to younger schoolchildren in conditions of widespread digitalisation, and to create the necessary pedagogical conditions for the development of a national-specific axiological system in primary school children, teachers should consider many factors. In particular, it is necessary to pay special attention to the development of teaching staff skills required for the competent application of modern information technologies. Ignoring this aspect of professional development of teaching staff can lead to an aggravation of miscommunication between generations and substantially complicate the inculcation of value orientations to younger generations. The results obtained in this study can be useful in organising educational work with elementary school students. Understanding and considering the specific features of the development of national values in children of primary school age will optimise both the background conditions of the pedagogical environment and conscious educational activities aimed at forming a national-specific value picture of the world in younger schoolchildren.",

    "abstract": "Automated face recognition plays a vital role in forensics. The most important evidence in the criminal investigation is the facial images captured from the crime scene, as they represent the identity of the people involved in crime. The role of law enforcement agencies is to identify the facial images from the suitable database. This information can be treated as strong evidence for the law enforcement agencies which becomes the most important evidence in global counter-terrorism initiatives. Contour of chin and cheek, distancebetween different features and shapes of facial components are some of the parameters considered by the forensic experts for manual facial identification process. This process is time consuming, and it is a tedious job. To address this issue, there is a need for developing an automated face recognition system for forensics. As a result, FaceNet \u2013 a framework for age variation facial digital images is discussed in this research work. Experiments are evaluated on CSA dataset with three age variations which provides a recognition accuracy of86.8% and performs better than the existing algorithms.",

    "title": "The political ecosystem of the digital age: integration of network and ecosystem approaches",
    "abstract": "\n The subject of the study is the influence of information and communication technologies (ICT) on the formation and development of the political ecosystem of society. The article analyzes and compares two key approaches \u2013 network and ecosystem, revealing different aspects of the digital transformation of political processes. Particular attention is paid to the need to integrate these approaches for a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the political ecosystem in the context of digitalization. The author proposes a theoretical model combining network and ecosystem concepts, which allows taking into account both the dynamics of horizontal interactions and the stability of the system. The research covers issues of civic identity, decentralization of power, and self-organization, demonstrating how digital platforms and patriotic content contribute to strengthening social cohesion and transforming the political environment. The work offers the author's definition of the political ecosystem of society, reflecting the complexity and multidimensionality of social processes in the era of digitalization.\u00a0The research methodology is based on a comparative analysis of network and ecosystem approaches in order to integrate them to create a comprehensive model of the political ecosystem. The analysis of theoretical concepts presented in the works of leading researchers is used, as well as conceptual modeling aimed at forming the author's model of the political ecosystem of society. The novelty of the research lies in the development and substantiation of an integrated model of the political ecosystem, which combines the principles of network and ecosystem approaches. The main conclusions of the study are the provisions that information and communication technologies (ICT) play a key role in the formation of horizontal political structures, ensuring the decentralization of power and self-organization of civil society. A special contribution of the author to the research of the topic is the formulation of the author's definition of a political ecosystem as a dynamic system where information flows and inter-network interactions occupy a central place. An important result of the research is the identification of factors that ensure the stability and adaptability of the political system in the context of digitalization. The practical significance of the work is shown in the possibility of using the developed model to analyze modern political processes, predict their development and form strategies for digital interaction between government institutions and society.\n",

    "title": "A Unique Identity based Automated Toll Collection System using RFID and Image Processing",
    "abstract": "The aim of this paper and its consequent result is to achieve a smart toll collection system for highway scenarios in India. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a possible solution to tackle the problems encountered in manual toll collections system like time spent at the toll plaza, cashless transactions, overcollection of toll charges, corruption on toll plaza, etc. Moreover, the proposed system would also help the authorities to solve the cases of vehicle theft very efficiently. In the proposed solution, the toll would be equipped with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and RFID sensing to collect information on passing vehicles and make hassle-free digital transactions based on the unique identification. In order to speed up the transaction time spent in data, a lookup table, a priority table based on GPS sectoring of vehicles in a radius of 200 M will be used. A key feature of the proposed system is that it uses central account for toll collection across the country so that the government will have the knowledge of toll charges collected at toll center, and it helps in reducing the overcollection of toll charges.",

    "title": "Paradoxes of Intermediation in Aadhaar: Human Making of a Digital Infrastructure",
    "abstract": "Abstract E-governance projects in India are often purported to minimise the role of human intermediaries. They rely on machines to curtail corruption and bring more efficiency to service delivery. However, studies have found human intermediation and its affordances to be crucial, especially in developing countries where social endowment gaps pose considerable barriers to the effective use of information and communication technologies. Human intermediation in technological infrastructure is thus invisible yet inevitable. I unravel this paradox of intermediation by examining the everyday practices of two sets of intermediaries in Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan associated with everyday workings of Aadhaar, India\u2019s digital biometric identity infrastructure. Looking at biometric technologies as \u2018situated practice\u2019, I draw on the notion of \u2018infrastructuring\u2019 to argue that the discretionary practices of human intermediaries in fact stabilise the technological system, anchoring it to a human infrastructure. So, as disruptive technologies such as Aadhaar are implemented, their effective usage will invariably rely on the potential agency of human intermediaries and their collaborative work practices.",

    "title": "Blockchain-Based Sensitive Document Storage to Mitigate Corruptions",
    "abstract": "Currently, all document processes in developing countries require third-party (human) verification; this makes said documents susceptible to human error. Blockchain technology makes the need for a central authority redundant as the devices needing to download digital assets are connected to one another via a peer-to-peer network. It allows for the exchange and storage of digital assets without the need for third-party oversight. The main objective of this article is to develop a blockchain solution in an attempt to mitigate corruption. The contribution details a document verification process as a solution to lessen third-party access to sensitive information and ensure that it is safe and untampered with. The solution proposed to this issue was the introduction of blockchain technology to aid in document verification. This makes the entire system decentralized and reduces the amount of third-party access to sensitive information. Using blockchain makes documents immutable thus reducing corrupt activity such as identity theft and ghost accounts. A blockchain implementation in the field of document verification also dissolves the need for certified copies, which then allows for better use of state funds and public service workers. This work can prove to be a major enabler to achieve sustainable development goal-16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).",

    "abstract": "Ensuring privacy and protection from issuer corruption in digital identity systems is crucial. We propose a method for selective disclosure and privacy-preserving revocation of digital credentials using second-order Elliptic Curves and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. We make holders able to present proofs of possession of selected credentials without disclosing them, and we protect their presentations from replay attacks. Re-vocations may be distributed among multiple revocation issuers using publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) and activated only by configurable consensus, ensuring robust protection against issuer corruption. Our system's unique design enables extremely fast revocation checks, even with large revocation lists, leveraging optimized hash map lookups.",

    "title": "Distributed Corruption Detection in Networks",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of distributed corruption detection in networks. In this model, each vertex of a directed graph is either truthful or corrupt. Each vertex reports the type (truthful or corrupt) of each of its outneighbors. If it is truthful, it reports the truth, whereas if it is corrupt, it reports adversarially. This model, first considered by Preparata, Metze, and Chien in 1967, motivated by the desire to identify the faulty components of a digital system by having the other components checking them, became known as the PMC model. The main known results for this model characterize networks in which \\emph{all} corrupt (that is, faulty) vertices can be identified, when there is a known upper bound on their number. \nWe are interested in networks in which the identity of a \\emph{large fraction} of the vertices can be identified. \nIt is known that in the PMC model, in order to identify all corrupt vertices when their number is $t$, all indegrees have to be at least $t$. In contrast, we show that in $d$ regular-graphs with strong expansion properties, a $1-O(1/d)$ fraction of the corrupt vertices, and a $1-O(1/d)$ fraction of the truthful vertices can be identified, whenever there is a majority of truthful vertices. We also observe that if the graph is very far from being a good expander, namely, if the deletion of a small set of vertices splits the graph into small components, then no corruption detection is possible even if most of the vertices are truthful. Finally, we discuss the algorithmic aspects and the computational hardness of the problem.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to determine the specifics of purchasing management in conditions of total digitalization. Based on the synthesis of concepts and research trends, activities in the management of pro-curement of material resources are identified, which contribute to the effective activities of business entities, digitalization priorities and effects in the procurement process. The article summarizes the advantages, ad-vantages and disadvantages of centralized, decentralized and mixed models of the organization of the pro-curement management system, taking into account the timing, identity of contracts, delegation of procurement functions, accuracy of order satisfaction, reduction of risks of bureaucratization and corruption. Vector zones of digital transformation of conditions and scope of procurement, intensity of climate change in the company, integration of intellectual, technological and efficient procurement process for the business as a whole are defined. It is emphasized that the system of digital procurement through machine training significantly trans-forms the procurement process, contributing to the prompt selection of the right type of competition, the iden-tification, definition and recognition of proven (law-abiding), customer-oriented suppliers, the identification of criteria for the optimal market price and the formation of conditions for effective purchase.",

    "title": "Cyberactivism and protest movements: the February 20th movement \u2013 the forming of a new generation in Morocco",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The digital revolution has drastically transformed the conventional system of political representation, participation and communication, bringing accordingly many cultural changes in the public sphere where collective action is built and new identity aspects are constructed. This article attempts to make sense of the February 20th movement youth activists\u2019 actions, understand their dynamics, analyse their mobilisation process, examine their paradoxes and highlight their promises from a social and political outlook. Youth activists in this movement used the internet as a tool to strategise, organise and mobilise supporters across the country to take the streets to demand for the democratisation of political institutions, lifting the veil on the dysfunctional and seriously out of touch political parties, more freedom of expression, more limits on the royal power and an end to corruption, nepotism and favouritism. To address this concern, a quantitative opinion survey was addressed to 100 activists in the February 20th movement in 2011 in three major cities in Morocco: Rabat, Casablanca and Meknes. The results obtained were significant with regard to gender participation in the movement, level of education, political affiliation and the use and manipulation of the Internet for political activism. Similarly, the manuscript shows that activists in the February 20th Movement have managed to transform the Moroccan society and changed the meaning of political participation and social debate in Morocco, altering, thus, Morocco's protest culture.",

    "abstract": "Currently, identity and document verification use either physical documentation or centralized digital databases. A central figure is responsible for verifying these documents and this is thought to prevent document tampering. However, this does not eliminate threats of external hacking or internal bad actors and individuals to commit acts of forgery. in addition, bureaucracy and delays often occur with central entities validating documents that causes wasted time for users. Blockchain technology has brought a positive impact to document traceability and transparency across institutions and industries. This research will analyse and use non-transferable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with smart contract functions which is a new concept for projecting digital and physical goods on a blockchain, it\u2019s expected to represent complicated operations in an effective manner for document traceability systems, enabling a decentralized approach while preventing fraud, corruption, tampering, and counterfeiting.",

    "abstract": "In this introduction the editors of the Special Issue of Sociologia del lavoro devoted to digital labor and the crisis of the wage-labor system, analyse recent trends in the scholarship of platform capitalism in the aftermath of the pandemic outbreak. Platforms are not only a type of business model - they have become a crucial infrastructure around which society reorganizes itself. They extract value not only from traditional labor activities, but also from the social cooperation. Their operations permeate even private spaces and turn social ties such as kinship, friendship, and sexuality into complex monetization schemes. This process represents a departure from the salary institution, where identity was mostly linked to the position occupied by each individual with respect to work and wages. Ultimately, the hidden dimension of digital capitalism is represented by automation which, contrary to the prevailing opinion, does not mark the decline of human labor. A huge amount of data, and data work, is required to deploy platforms' algorithms. Such work is performed by under- and micro-paid remote providers, often residing in lowincome countries. Even if platform capitalism appears stronger since the Covid-19 outbreak, it is far from mastering the global challenges it triggers. As its contradic tions become apparent, new struggles of digital workers become more visible and better organized.",

    "title": "The digital identity of legal entities: Current status and the way forward",
    "abstract": "Electronic communication continues to grow in importance as a tool to support trade in goods and services, in particular between buyers and sellers based in different countries. Banks, for example, have notably extensive experience in this area, while public administrations are increasingly developing e-government services for their domestic needs. As the supply chain has become international, the need has arisen for global standards to define the identities of trading partners for the purposes of invoicing, customs declarations and payments. Businesses, consumers and government agencies are all faced with the challenge to understand \u2018who is who\u2019 in the digital and global supply chain. This requires a global approach to identity management. This paper discusses the fundamental issues regarding identities in business applications and payment systems.",

    "title": "The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age: State Concerns and Initiatives in Bangladesh",
    "abstract": "Privacy is a basic human right, necessary for protecting individual identity. The right to privacy has become an undisputable component of human rights, recognized by various legislative systems, social traditions, and human understanding. However, the unprecedented growth of communication and information technology poses unparalleled threats to individual privacy, especially in the digital era. Constitutional and statutory guarantees of privacy in Bangladesh have not been able to keep pace with these developments. Privacy and Data Protection across the globe have been strengthened by instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, OECD Data Protection Guidelines (1980, revised 2013), EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2018) and UK's Data Protection Act (DPA) (2018). Principles of privacy have also been developed through judicial recognition in various jurisdictions including USA, UK, EU and India. This paper aims to critically analyze the provisions of privacy and data protection in Bangladesh, highlight the gaps in them as compared to international standards, and recommend a way forward keeping in mind the global trends of the digital age.",

    "title": "The future of Digital Student Data Portability: the Groningen Declaration",
    "abstract": "Paper based diplomas are easy to forge and require a noticeable amount of expertise to verify, especially when presented in a different country from the one that produced them. The so-called diploma mills, illegal operations that sell fake degrees, are running rampant at the moment. Moving to fully digital diplomas can prevent these problems. Digital identity technologies can be used for providing controlled access to verifiable information about an individual academic achievement. The Groningen Declaration has become the centre of a world wide effort to join efforts dedicated to the creation of Digital Diploma Deposits, encompassing developments from China through Mexico and Norway through South Africa. At the core of this efforts lays the work of groups like EUNIS's own RS3G (Rome Students Systems and Standards Group), EAIE's DSDP (Digital Student Data Portability), USA National Student Clearing House or TERENA TF-EMC2. The aim of the present paper and the corresponding presentation is to increase awareness in the European University ICT community of the efforts that surround the Declaration, by presenting the achievements of the first year of its existence, like the meeting that took place in April 2013 in Beijing hosted by CHESSIC and the Chinese MoE.",

    "title": "An Architecture for Biometric Electronic Identification Document System Based on Blockchain \u2020",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes an architecture for biometric electronic identification document (e-ID) system based on Blockchain for citizens identity verification in transactions corresponding to the notary, registration, tax declaration and payment, basic health services and registration of economic activities, among others. To validate the user authentication, a biometric e-ID system is used to avoid spoofing and related attacks. Also, to validate the document a digital certificate is used with the corresponding public and private key for each citizen by using a user\u2019s PIN. The proposed transaction validation process was implemented on a Blockchain system in order to record and verify the transactions made by all citizens registered in the electoral census, which guarantees security, integrity, scalability, traceability, and no-ambiguity. Additionally, a Blockchain network architecture is presented in a distributed and decentralized way including all the nodes of the network, database and government entities such as national register and notary offices. The results of the application of a new consensus algorithm to our Blockchain network are also presented showing mining time, memory and CPU usage when the number of transactions scales up.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to carry out a multi-faceted analysis of the dynamics of the development of parliamentarism and digital constitutionalism, to identify possible challenges and threats, as well as prospects for parliaments and parliamentary activity in the conditions of the spread of modern digital\u00a0 \u00a0(electronic) technologies. Approaches to understanding and defining the phenomena of \u00abparliamentarism\u00bb, \u00abconstitutionalism\u00bb,\u00a0\u00a0 \u00abdigital constitutionalism\u00bb,\u00a0\u00a0 some\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0\u00a0 their\u00a0\u00a0 modifications and features are highlighted, their multifaceted nature, transformation in the conditions of modern progressive digital development, electronic democracy is emphasized. Crisis and conflict events have largely become challenges for parliaments and parliamentary activity, as well as digitalization and digitization processes and tools. It is important that parliamentary institutions of various levels (national, supranational, inter-parliamentary associations, their auxiliary bodies and services) contribute to the development and regulation of these processes, using advanced and effective digital technologies tested in practice. The \u00abDigital Compass\u00bb for the EU Digital Decade (2030), the concept of digital sovereignty, the adopted charters of digital rights (Catalan, Nice), the Law on Digital Markets, the Law on Digital Services, the Law on Artificial Intelligence, the Declaration on European Digital Rights and Principles should be singled out. (2022), \u00abWorld e-Parliament Report\u00bb of the IPU, the concept of e-democracy of the European Parliament, the resolution on e-democracy of the PACE, recommendations on open government and electronic participation of citizens OECD. Thanks to this, new forms and tools for the implementation of existing human rights are introduced, as well as new digital rights are constituted (to access the Internet, to identity in the digital environment, to protection in the digital environment, non-discrimination, etc.). In the same way, the forms and methods of activity of parliaments are being modernized (expansion of platforms for online broadcasts of plenary and committee meetings, electronic (remote) voting, improvement of interactive websites with access to draft laws and other documents, and systems of electronic petitions and consultations with voters, electronic participation of citizens and public organizations in the legislative process). However, the development of digital parliamentarism and digital democracy is accompanied by numerous challenges (digital inequality, low digital literacy of members of parliaments and parliamentary services, cyber threats, material and financial costs etc.). This requires a thorough study of the issues raised, improvement of digital culture, improvement of parliamentary and non-parliamentary procedures, along with further development of technological infrastructure, cyber security protection of the components of digital parliamentarism.",

    "title": "Privacy and Data Protection Practices of Digital Lending Apps in Kenya",
    "abstract": "The Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law (CIPIT) has been studying the impact of digital identities on society.\u00a0 This has included policy research on the legal and technical aspects of the national digital ID system Huduma Namba under which the Government is integrating all its identification documents. This research shows that the national digital identity system also integrates with privately issued digital identities such as mobile phone numbers and social media accounts.\u00a0\u00a0 We anticipate that as national digital ID uses increase, so will the linkage with private systems. This is already evident from e-government services, where payments for Government services, such as passport applications, drivers\u2019 licences, national health insurance and hospital bills in public hospitals are made using mobile money platforms. We also appreciate that private digital ID is more developed and has more uses than national digital ID. For example, a 2019 survey, undertaken by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), estimates that access to financial products had risen from 26.7% in 2006 to 89% of the population in 2019. This is attributed partly to the availability of digital products such as \u201cmobile banking, agency banking, digital finance and mobile apps\u201d.\u00a0 These products make use of personal data, which broadly falls under digital identities. This study seeks to understand the privacy implications of digital ID by looking at digital lending apps.",

    "abstract": ": From 1 January 2024, the Indonesian government will require all parties administering the administration to use a 16-digit National Identity Number (NIK) and Tax Identi\ufb01cation Number (NPWP). The purpose of this paper is to gather the challenges and dif\ufb01culties encountered by the Indonesian Government in implementing the system. Given that digital identity has been applied in stages until now, digital e-KTP has been in the trial phase in 58 districts/cities since 2021. The desk research method is used in this study, which is supplemented by qualitative interviews. The \ufb01ndings of this study are expected to help the government improve the implementation of the single identi\ufb01cation number based on the theory of equity, certainty, tax compliance, and tax evasion.",

    "abstract": "The Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law (CIPIT) has been studying the impact of digital identities on society.\u00a0 This has included policy research on the legal and technical aspects of the national digital ID system Huduma Namba under which the Government is integrating all its identification documents. This research shows that the national digital identity system also integrates with privately issued digital identities such as mobile phone numbers and social media accounts.\u00a0\u00a0 We anticipate that as national digital ID uses increase, so will the linkage with private systems. This is already evident from e-government services, where payments for Government services, such as passport applications, drivers\u2019 licences, national health insurance and hospital bills in public hospitals are made using mobile money platforms. We also appreciate that private digital ID is more developed and has more uses than national digital ID. For example, a 2019 survey, undertaken by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), estimates that access to financial products had risen from 26.7% in 2006 to 89% of the population in 2019. This is attributed partly to the availability of digital products such as \u201cmobile banking, agency banking, digital finance and mobile apps\u201d.\u00a0 These products make use of personal data, which broadly falls under digital identities. This study seeks to understand the privacy implications of digital ID by looking at digital lending apps.",

    "title": "Banks\u2019 Digital Challenges",
    "abstract": "Digital currencies make transfers in digital markets, providing transaction participants with many advantages: easy access to markets, maintaining the identity of participants in transfer transactions, even their application is constantly expanding when buying new and innovative goods. Banks are an integral and significant part of this turnover, which gives them additional advantages and direct effects and exposes them to additional difficulties and dangers. The increased interest in them was noted mainly due to the continuous growth of their market rate and the additional growth of cryptocurrency extraction. Most transactions with them are based on the regulations of the applicable law. Still, the possibility of being the object of a crime has provoked a backlash from financial supervisors to protect the rights of other market participants and especially banks as the most accessible of all. Although it is a legal system in place to prevent banking institutions from being involved in money laundering operations, digital currencies are now a new opportunity with the specific advantages that ensure their smooth transfer to the network. The leading business companies such as TESLA have offered the opportunity to buy electric cars with digital currencies, with the growing demand for cryptocurrency services. Partly aided by the rising value of essential natural resources, important components for building information infrastructure, and the Covid-19 pandemic, significant financial institutions have permanently established themselves in digital markets such as JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, and Morgan Stanley, BlackRock and many others. Despite the targeted actions of state regulatory institutions, whose duty is to ensure the public good \u201ccybersecurity\u201d, the mass entry into these markets leaves consumers relatively unprotected. Money laundering or terrorist financing often provokes crises among regulatory institutions because they are usually accompanied by arms deals, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and others, as well as tax fraud, terrorism, and drug trafficking. A current application of digital currencies is their use to pay for services related to cyber attacks on financial institutions, objects of national security, etc. when the entire population suffers the damage. The new roles of financial institutions in the digital markets strengthen the notion of compliance as possible risk threats, realizing through compliance functions to automate and implement the integrated approach to all types of risk that accompanies the movement of digital financial assets. For some banking intermediaries, this has changed their cybersecurity strategy.",

    "title": "Food Passports and Intelligent Food Recipes: The Data-Oriented Way of Producing Food",
    "abstract": "This paper discusses a Multiagent System architecture and its supporting concepts and technical implementation for food-producing systems. The Food and Beverages industry is in dire need of embracing more advanced industrial digitization practices to be able to meet immediate sustainability requirements. One such challenge is improving and optimizing resource utilization. A more rationalized use of raw materials, production processes and machinery is a key aspect of the latter. At the same time, food is still produced, in many instances, in a very traditional way, particularly when it comes to ingredient selection. The architecture introduced in this paper has the ambition of articulating the supply and demand of food products based in the technical characteristics of food (e.g., composition, nutritional content and value, processing efficiency, and taste profiles) instead of the more traditional characteristics. To that end, the paper introduces, among other key concepts, the notion of the Digital Food Identity Card as an active digital document that stores such technical information and the notion of Dynamic Recipe as an active software entity with the dynamic capability of adjusting production parameters in a recipe to market conditions, as well as coordinating the resources included in the execution of a industrial food recipe. Both concepts are modeled as agents and part of the proposed architecture. Finally, the paper provides a formal grammar for a domain specific language, that can be used by human specialists to define a dynamic recipe and be simultaneously interpreted by Dynamic Recipe Agents to enact the behaviours previously described. The domain specific language is an integral part of the architecture, together with the agent-based formulation, and an important link in creating an effectively data-oriented way of articulating different stake-holder concerns. The proposed solution is informed by requirements elicited within domain experts and sustainability targets that food-producing companies currently must adhere to.",

    "title": "Evaluation of an Interactive Solution for Reminiscence and Communication",
    "abstract": "Communication with older adults and/or people with cognitive impairments could be supported by gathered information about the person\u2019s history or his/her preferences (Rehn, 2015). By using information about the persons preferences and wishes, the sense of belonging and the persons social identity could be strengthened (Turner, 1999). Digital tools addressing this area often consist of static information about the older adult, and they do not consider that we as human beings constantly are changing (Sj\u00f6linder et al., 2023). Further, most of these tools have the focus on providing information to the care giving staff instead of being a tool that can be used together and create an experience.In an ongoing project an interactive solution that supports reminiscence and communication with older adults was developed. The solution consists of hardware units in terms of a tablet, interactive devices and a charging station that is combined with a removable tray. The tablet is used for interaction and communication with the system. By using the tablet, general collections of discussion topics can be accessed. The system also has the possibility to gather information and create personal profiles. The information for the personal profiles is gathered by using the tablet to play simple mini games. For example, the older adults can play a mini game where they are presented to items and give these items thumb up or thumb down. Based on the answers a personal profile is built up. The interactive devices are physical devices resembling stones in the size of approximately 15 cm. The devices (\u201cthe stones\u201d) have a screen were text or images can be presented. They also have light emitting diodes for conveying different moods and the possibility to play sounds. From the tablet, collections of content can be sent to the stones that presents the items on the screen to provide topics for the conversation. The charging station consists of a part that can be removed (the tray). The aim of this is to make it possible to carry around several stones at the same time. This paper will present a study examining the usage of the solution described above. The study was conducted in collaboration with older adults and staff at a nursing home in Sweden. In one part of the study, the researchers used the solution in the interaction with the older adults. In the other part of the study the staff at the nursing home used the solution in the interaction with the older adults. In both cases two sessions were held with each older adult, one to gather information (playing the mini games), and one session where the gathered content was used in a conversation. After each session with the older adults, questions were asked about the usage of the solution and about aspects related to how they have perceived the solution and the situation. After the sessions that was held between older adults and care giving staff similar questions were given, but in these interviews questions about the care givers perspective were added.ReferencesRehn, A.

    "title": "An Architecture for Biometric Electronic Identification Document System Based on Blockchain \u2020",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes an architecture for biometric electronic identification document (e-ID) system based on Blockchain for citizens identity verification in transactions corresponding to the notary, registration, tax declaration and payment, basic health services and registration of economic activities, among others. To validate the user authentication, a biometric e-ID system is used to avoid spoofing and related attacks. Also, to validate the document a digital certificate is used with the corresponding public and private key for each citizen by using a user\u2019s PIN. The proposed transaction validation process was implemented on a Blockchain system in order to record and verify the transactions made by all citizens registered in the electoral census, which guarantees security, integrity, scalability, traceability, and no-ambiguity. Additionally, a Blockchain network architecture is presented in a distributed and decentralized way including all the nodes of the network, database and government entities such as national register and notary offices. The results of the application of a new consensus algorithm to our Blockchain network are also presented showing mining time, memory and CPU usage when the number of transactions scales up.",

    "abstract": "Number plate is the identity of a car. The existing number utilizes an old system that is prepared manually. Besides that, the road tax renewal is another manual process where users have to wait for a long queue or learn to use online option. In this proposed system, wireless application using digital plate was configured to help manage the renewal process. Using this proposed system, users are able to update their road tax by utilizing the digital screen, hence, reduces the time and resources needed. The system applies a serial input and there is no need to stick road tax on the windshield. In addition, there is an option where user can trigger an alert to indicate if the car is stolen and establish a panic situation by activating the car siren automatically in order to alert the nearby security officers.",

    "title": "REVIEW OF DIGITAL IDENTITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM MODELS",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Public and private Institutions are presently facing challenges in the control of users accessing information via online platforms. Institutions presently control classified user identity information via online platforms. Trends indicate there is insignificant control of classified information within organizations, making it one of the serious threats facing governments and organizations. Digital Identity Management Systems (DIMS) are very vital in organization infrastructure for the purpose of authenticating users and supporting unlimited access control of services. The core intention of this paper is to review the existing digital identity management models and analyze the extent of the research work. \nMethodology: The paper will review the characteristics of Digital Identity Management Models and evaluate on how trust and privacy issues impact or influence the establishment of an effective digital identity management system. \nFindings: This paper reviews existing digital identity management system models. Regulation of information in cases when the entities requiring access to it are both highly diverse and spread is among the most significant challenges to effective identity management. A variety of normal technical questions also faces the field, for example, the manner in which information in centralized and distributed databases can be controlled. In a bid to ensure that information related to authorization and authentication is up to date and dependable within an organization\u2019s systems of information, handling personnel has been a major concern of identity management systems. \nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: A hybrid digital Identity Management System model approach that will aim at solving the gaps identified in the existing digital identity models will be the future paper\u2019s subject of concern.",

    "abstract": "Malaysia is in the process of developing a new identity system to provide citizens and residents with secure and efficient access to digital services. This study aimed to determine the responsiveness of the Malaysian population to new technologies and evaluate their opinions on managing their identity online. The study employed a quantitative research design and collected data through an online questionnaire. A total of 1,014 participants from Malaysia, aged 18 years and above, were included in the study, and the data were analysed using cross-tabulation analysis. The theoretical framework of the study was based on the technology acceptance model, the risk and negative consequences theory of individuals' perceptions, and the organizational trustworthiness theory. The results showed that various demographic characteristics influence individuals' attitudes towards technology adoption and online identity management. Gender, age, ethnicity/race, work status, employment sector, level of education, place of living, household income level, and residence state were all significantly associated with early adoption of emerging technologies, trying out new technologies, and enjoyment of trying out new technologies. Certain demographic factors may also have an impact on people's preferences for specific identity management tools. The study also found significant relationships between various demographic factors and trust levels when it comes to personal data. The study findings have implications for policymakers and practitioners involved in promoting the adoption of new technologies and the management of online identities. The study's findings may assist policymakers in implementing better measures for protecting Malaysians' online identity and privacy. Additionally, the results could also inform future research investigating technology adoption and acceptance among Malaysians.",

    "title": "Interoperable Blockchain Solution For Digital Identity Management",
    "abstract": "Identity management is the set of policies, processes, and technologies used for managing access to information systems, safeguarding digital data, and tracking system activities. The existing Identity management system is not that secure, reliable, distributed and trustworthy. All these systems containing digital information are vulnerable to getting hacked or sometimes act as a malicious entity if the data is altered on central servers. Data breaches, including confidential data, are happening regularly. Blockchain on the other hand is one of the most emerging technologies that has gained a lot of attention in the past 5\u20136 years. Blockchain can address most of the issues with the existing identity management system. Over few years, various dApps have been created using Blockchain Framework (leveraging PKI system) to solve the problem of Digital Identity Management, but at the same time, most of the work done is compromising the feature of decentralization (systems based on Centralization as Verifiable Credentials / Public-Private Keys are stored in the central server for verification). In this system, the authors have proposed an interoperable blockchain solution for Identity Management. The purpose of this research work is to study the feasibility of whether or not we can use interoperable blockchain solutions for Identity and Access Management. The authors were able to create a PoC for illustrating the same. This system was able to complete the authentication and verification process within 1 second, and all the necessary functions created to test the feasibility was able to execute within 1 second. Also in this system authors have achieved full decentralization.",

    "abstract": "Digital transformation and the utilization of Industrial IoT (IIoT) introduces numerous interconnected devices to factories increasing among others the challenge of managing their software versions and giving attackers new possibilities to exploit various software vulnerabilities. \nFactory networks were earlier isolated from the Internet. However, this separation is no longer valid and there can be connections that allow intruders to penetrate into information systems of factories. Another issue is that although factories typically are physically isolated, it is not necessarily safe to assume that physical security is in good shape as the novel supply networks comprise subcontracted activities and temporary work force. Another threat can also arise from unauthorized monitoring of devices and the unauthorized replacement of existing ones. \nBased on the previous, it is crucial that IIoT security should be built into factories of the future (FoF) right from the design phase and even low-end devices need to be supported. Trusted computing concept called remote attestation should be used. Remote attestation allows remote parties to verify the integrity of each system component. System components should include trusted hardware components that can be used to measure executable software. The term measurement means calculating the cryptographic hash of the binary component before passing control to it. Trusted hardware components should also have a mechanism to protect the integrity of the measurement list and cryptographic keys that can be used to sign integrity assertions. The verifier part should have a storage of reference integrity metrics identifying the expected values of these measurements. \nDeploying trusted computing and remote attestation concepts to industrial automation is not straightforward. Even if it is possible to use remote attestation with suitable hardware components, it is not clear how remote attestation should be integrated with various operational technology (OT) industrial automation protocols. Approaches to use remote attestation with existing industrial automation protocols (e.g., OPC UA) is discussed. Advanced identity and access management (e.g., OAuth2, OpenID Connect) can be used to combine integrity measurements with device identity information so that the remote attestation process is triggered by authentication during the first transaction. The focus is on machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with immutable device identities and integrity evidence transfer.",

    "title": "Self-Sovereign Identity in Semi-Permissioned Blockchain Networks Leveraging Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric",
    "abstract": "Patients often have their healthcare data stored in centralized systems, leading to challenges when reconciling or consolidating their data across providers due to centralized databases that store patient identities. The challenges disrupt the flow of patient care where time is sensitive for both patients and providers. Decentralized technologies have enabled a new identity model\u2013Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)\u2013that grants individuals the right to freely control, access, and share their own data. This work proposes a system that achieves SSI in a semi-permissioned blockchain network using an open protocol as the certificate of authority and several guidelines for securely handling transactions in the network. Open protocols like Keccak can grant access to a permission-based network such as Hyperledger Fabric. The network architecture ensures data security and privacy through mechanisms of multi-signature transactions and guidelines for storing transactions locally, making this architecture ideal for privacy-centered use cases, such as healthcare data-sharing applications. The ultimate goal is to give patients full control over their identity and other data derived from their identity within a semi-permissioned network.",

    "title": "Integration of Digital Public Services Mall Application with a Citizen Centric Government Services Approach",
    "abstract": "The integration of government services represents a practical solution in the context of the numerous applications developed by both Central and Regional Governments, particularly those used to access public service applications. The Digital Public Service Mall application can be leveraged by Regional Governments through data integration, enhanced with Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. This will facilitate collaboration between Regional Apparatus Organizations (OPD), enabling them to work together as technical managers of public services. Consequently, this will simplify public access to these services, eliminating the need for repeated data entry processes. Additionally, this system can be developed using facial recognition (FR) technology, which can be integrated with the Digital Population Identity (IKD). The concept of Citizen-Centric Government Services has been widely adopted by governments in various countries to bring government services closer to their citizens. This research focuses on analyzing the integration of data and public service applications, specifically the Digital Public Service Mall (MPP) application in West Java Province. The data analysis technique employed is descriptive-analytical with a qualitative approach. The Citizen-Centric Government Services framework assists in analyzing the extent of data and application integration implementation in a government service. This framework outlines the dimensions within it based on achievement indicators aligned with expectations. Data collection includes semi-structured interviews, participatory observations, and documentation. Based on the analysis results using the dimensional approach within the Citizen-Centric Government Services Framework, it is evident that the Digital MPP application of West Java Province is optimally utilized by the Regency/City Governments and the people of West Java Province. The analysis using the Citizen-Centric Government Services Framework approach reveals that several achievement indicators within each dimension can be met through effective collaboration between the government and the community.",

    "title": "A User-Centric Self-Sovereign Identity-Based Authentication Framework for Decentralized Data Management in Healthcare Settings",
    "abstract": "Establishing identities and privacy in the modern digital landscape faces critical challenges, such as counterfeit identities, identity theft, and data breaches. These issues have significant implications for the healthcare system. To address these concerns, access control and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) play vital roles in creating a privacy-conscious ecosystem. SSI enables user-centric management of identification credentials and electronic health records (EHR), allowing users to validate their credentials without relying on central or external servers. The proposed work is an innovative approach to identifying various stakeholders in the healthcare system. By utilizing cryptographic proofs, the proposed method instills trust in the stakeholder's identity. Moreover, the proposed work successfully mitigates various security attacks. The demonstration of this work leverages the Hyperledger Aries framework and a test blockchain network called Von-network.",

    "title": "T-FIM: Transparency in Federated Identity Management for Decentralized Trust and Forensics Investigation",
    "abstract": "Federated Identity Management (FIM) has gained significant adoption as a means to simplify user authentication and service authorization across diverse domains. It serves as a centralized authentication and authorization method, enabling users to access various applications or resources using credentials issued by a universally trusted identity provider (IdP). However, recent security incidents indicate that the reliability of credentials issued by IdP is not absolute in practice. If the IdP fails, it can persistently access any application that trusts it as any user. This poses a significant security threat to the entire system. Furthermore, with the increasing adoption of FIM across diverse scenarios, there is a growing demand for the development of an identity management system that can effectively support digital forensics investigations into malicious user behavior. In this work, we introduce transparency to federated identity management, proposing T-FIM to supervise unconditional trust. T-FIM employs privacy-preserving logs to record all IdP-issued tokens, ensuring that only the true owner can access the exact token. We utilize identity-based encryption (IBE), but not just as a black box, encrypting tokens before they are publicly recorded. In addition, we propose a decentralized private key generator (DPKG) to provide IBE private keys for users, avoiding the introduction of a new centralized trust node. T-FIM also presents a novel approach to digital forensics that enables forensic investigators to collect evidence in a privacy-preserving manner with the cooperation of the DPKG. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the correctness, security, and privacy aspects of T-FIM. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of T-FIM, we evaluated the additional overhead through experimental evaluations. Additionally, we compared its performance with other similar schemes to provide a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and advantages.",

Information systems play nowadays a crucial and fundamental role in hospital work-flows, thus providing great opportunities to introduce and improve upon \"patient empowerment\" processes for the personalization and management of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). In this paper, we present a patient's privacy generic control mechanisms scenarios based on the Extended OpenID (eOID), a user centric digital identity provider previously developed by our group, which leverages a secured OpenID 2.0 infrastructure with the recently released Portuguese Citizen Card (CC) for secure authentication in a distributed health information environment. eOID also takes advantage of Oauth assertion based mechanisms to implement patient controlled secure qualified role based access to his EHR, by third parties.",
