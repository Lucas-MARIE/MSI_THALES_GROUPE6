Fraud products, counterfeiting, and duplication are the current marketplace's major problems. This aims to develop a system for verifying product identification with their information, ownership, and validity detail.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: The proposed system applies Extreme Programming (XP) to reduce the risk caused by the fixed-time project using new technology and thus the final project could be delivered in time. Solidity and metamask being new technologies were unstable and to adopt the changes, the agile development model was the best through ABI and the bytecode are deployed into the Ethereum Blockchain.\nFindings/Result: This system maintains the buyers, sellers, and product details in a decentralized blockchain platform. This research details the entire product development process from planning, analysis, design, implementation, and testing for systematic online purchasing. Verifying the product ownership and its information to get the original product is the major difficulty in this space, but this research systematically solves some of those problems. This signifies an improvement in the current centralized way of purchasing goods online, where the information remains as it is entered by the seller while listing the product in Nepal and developing countries context.\nOriginality/Value: The study has produced a decentralized, reliable, secure, and third-party independent marketplace for buying and selling products for fraud free market.\nPaper Type: Research paper", "citationCount": 4, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://zenodo.org/record/7798162/files/7.%20Business%20Operation%20Using%20Identification.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-29", "authors": [{"authorId": "50997098", "name": "Ajay K.

As a result, developing methods for managing the road network, including effective project programming to make the best possible use of limited money, has become increasingly vital. However, in the 1960s, the World Bank initiated model developments to guide investment decisions on road infrastructure in developing nations, which gained traction since most of these investments are supported by donor agencies. A significant issue in introducing these models or systems in developing countries is the lack of a comprehensive priority subsystem as a program and monetary planning tool. The essential functions of such a tool are to detect the network status at various points in time, empower requirements identification, and evaluate multiple policies on a temporary but detailed basis within the context of network management. This paper presents a practical and comprehensive system to deal with the above problem. The paper's Geographical Information and Road Asset Management System (GIRAMS) is a Web-based integrated system that provides enhanced operational efficiency for road funding agencies and their implementation partners in the proper management of the road networks and ancillary infrastructures. The subsystem, Advanced Road Asset Management (ARAMS), was developed to conform to the interface of HDM-4, RONET, and RED for Economic Analysis. In addition to these subsystems, the RAMS is enriched with analytical tools such as Asset Valuation, Budgeting, and Multi-Year Work Programming. In addition, predictive models such as Road Deterioration and Work Effects Models were also built into the ARAMS.", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "2205227894", "name": "Raphael Kafui Natsui"}, {"authorId": "77460829", "name": "K.

In developing countries like Bangladesh, disease classification process mostly remains manual, time consuming and sometimes erroneous. Designing an E-health system comprised of disease identification model would be a great aid in such circumstances. The automation of identifying the diseases with the help of machine learning will be more accurate and time-saving. In this paper, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, k-NN, MLP, and SVM machine learning techniques are applied for three diseases: Dengue, Diabetes, and Thyroid. MLP for Dengue, Logistic Regression for Diabetes, and Random Forest for Thyroid performed the best with accuracies of 88.3%, 82.5%, and 98.5% respectively. Additionally, a medical specialist recommendation model and a medicine suggestion model are also integrated in the proposed E-Health system.", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "9207257", "name": "Md.

A Sequential Mixed-Method approach of the OLMT-project includes qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted. The data have been collected from the targeted population working on the OLMT-project through a questionnaire. The main key finding of the study indicates that poor planning and a lack of communication between the public and government led to frustration. The most significant factors that identified in the study were unsafe to work practice, project scope constraints, lack in technical and material support, unsafe/bad condition, health/environment degradation, declination and loss of resources and time, no proper emergency system, and negligence in adopting safety rules and laws. The study also revealed that the consensus should also be noticed between the key stakeholders (e.g., contractors, clients, safety officials, academia) in the second round of the Delphi survey of the project. The study findings will help the key stakeholders to prioritize their energies towards attaining zero levels of inadequate health and safety practices in infrastructure projects.

Therefore this paper proposes a machine learning based system for automatic identification and monitoring of Fall Army worm Moths. The system will aim to address challenges that are associated with trap based FAW monitoring such as manual data collection as the system will automate the data collection process. The study will aim to automate the data collection process by developing a machine learning algorithm for FAW moth identification. The study will develop web and mobile applications integrated with Geographic information system (GIS) technology in addition to trap automation. The tools developed in this study will aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of FAW monitoring by reducing the aspect of human intervention. At the time of writing this paper, only the web based tool prototype has been developed, therefore this paper mostly focuses on the design of the web based tool. The paper also provides a brief quantification of the chosen machine learning technique to be used in the study.", "citationCount": 6, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-03-07", "authors": [{"authorId": "90174403", "name": "Francis Chulu"}, {"authorId": "2978519", "name": "J.

Different methods of marking animals were used by Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and nomadic people of Scandinavia, Asia, Africa and pre-Hispanic Americans for different purposes (Caja et al., 2004). According to Bowling et al. (2008) and Vallat (2009), identification was initially applied to particularly valuable animals such as horses which were used by the Chinese postal system or by Roman charioteers. Following these early beginnings, animal identification and traceability have become widely recognized as essential tools for ensuring the safety of livestock products and facilitating veterinary disease surveillance and control (Blancou, 2001). Lately, animal identification of livestock had been extended to include breeding and production management, control of disease outbreaks, establishment of ownership, and requirement for export and consumer demands (Bowling et al., 2008). Livestock identification and trace back system (LITS), which were introduced in some African Countries, for instance Namibia and Botswana over 11 years ago has largely failed to meet the expectations of both the Government of Botswana (GoB) and the beef sector (FAO, 2010). In Nigeria, Livestock identification and trace back system (LITS) are experiencing policy and implementation challenges. Therefore, this paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of animal identification and traceability using electronic methods of livestock identification, as well as, challenges to Livestock identification and trace back system (LITS) implementation.

A baseline CNN model was created in Tensorflow/Keras and trained and tested using the Sep-28k dataset, an annotated stuttering database of 28,000 3-second clips. We built individual models for each disfluency label and measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure. The models were built five times, and the averages were taken of each metric. Three different training-validation-test splits were used: 80-10-10, 70-20-10, and 60-20-20. The models performed very well on the public dataset, exceeding the accuracy and F1 measure of other classifiers. The proposed ASIS can help speech pathologists improve the quality of life of stutterers especially in developing countries immensely, and thus it can make a significant difference for millions around the world.", "citationCount": 5, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2306672289", "name": "Yash Prabhu"}, {"authorId": "1809915", "name": "Naeem Seliya"}], "references": [{"paperId": "744454684e4bac7ed2d87018741be5e1a2d01cca", "title": "Detecting Dysfluencies in Stuttering Therapy Using wav2vec 2.0"}, {"paperId": "fbe06c42e0a770faa8afac470223963bb0425fbb", "title": "Visualizing Automatic Speech Recognition - Means for a Better Understanding?"}, {"paperId": "913ab3a206ab9e5eb78f562db8257c67a43bed44", "title": "Machine Learning for Stuttering Identification: Review, Challenges & Future Directions"}, {"paperId": "91f8ae52896efe45d017357d297975ebc012a471", "title": "Analysis and Tuning of a Voice Assistant System for Dysfluent Speech"}, {"paperId": "6664b5be04c11acc04f2eba37886a3482d4f546f", "title": "SEP-28k: A Dataset for Stuttering Event Detection from Podcasts with People Who Stutter"}, {"paperId": "4470ecd2070dc2c6e0988134e11b1b988d66fa41", "title": "Detecting Multiple Speech Disfluencies Using a Deep Residual Network with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory"}, {"paperId": "e915302e0ed6c23e5f5aa1bf34636ca86ca2164e", "title": "Automatic framework to aid therapists to diagnose children who stutter"}, {"paperId": "8c12df7d6f8cf3a82c38a4af7c443949d645e120", "title": "A Lightly Supervised Approach to Detect Stuttering in Children's Speech"}, {"paperId": "da6e404d8911b0e5785019a79dc8607e0b313dc4", "title": "Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition"}, {"paperId": "aeb740c34318ece1d67e814ca7b7d18a16e90fbb", "title": "A Survey of Telepractice in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology in India"}, {"paperId": "64f804f72fd746b6a497f1cacbce73518be81c3b", "title": "The impact of stuttering on the quality of life in adults who stutter."}, {"paperId": "aafe2e53018187ae6acde09ac73cd83f4caf4bdd", "title": "Stuttering Research and Treatment Around the World: India"}, {"paperId": "25b8ecbee6d9aa6f98bdeb48b4a2ea870c5f3760", "title": "Epidemiology of stuttering in the community across the entire life span."}, {"paperId": "d1639b463af59a0384f93a7b1edb0486649d00e3", "title": "Development of a two-stage procedure for the automatic recognition of dysfluencies in the speech of children who stutter: II.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), birth registration rates remain low, with millions of children going unregistered each year. Understanding the predictors of birth registration among children in this sub-region is important for developing targeted interventions to improve registration rates. The study examines the predictors of birth registration among children in SSA. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of secondary data pooled from the Demographic and Health Survey of 17 countries conducted from 2015 to 2021. A weighted sample of 162,500 children was included in the final analysis. We summarized the proportion of birth registration among children in SSA using a forest plot. We utilized a multilevel binary logistic regression analysis to examine the predictors of birth registration. The results were presented using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results We found that 48.32% [48.15\u201348.49] of births in SSA were registered. The lowest and highest prevalence of birth registration were found in Ethiopia (2.70 [2.38\u20133.02]) and Sierra Leone (92.93 [92.36\u201393.50]), respectively. Increasing child\u2019s age was found to be significantly associated with a higher likelihood of birth registrations, with those aged 4 years [aOR\u2009=\u20091.55; CI\u2009=\u20091.49, 1.62] having the highest odds of birth registration compared to those aged below 1 year. Children born to mothers with primary [aOR\u2009=\u20091.17; CI\u2009=\u20091.11, 1.24], secondary [aOR\u2009=\u20091.44; CI\u2009=\u20091.34, 1.54], and higher education [aOR\u2009=\u20091.71; CI\u2009=\u20091.48, 1.99] were more likely to be registered than those born to mothers who had no formal education. Also, children born in health facilities were more likely to be registered [aOR\u2009=\u20091.60; CI\u2009=\u20091.48, 1.74] than those born at home. The odds of birth registration were significantly higher among children whose mothers received assistance during delivery [aOR\u2009=\u20091.88; CI\u2009=\u20091.72, 2.04], those in the richest wealth index [aOR\u2009=\u20093.91; CI\u2009=\u20093.54, 4.33], and those in rural areas [aOR\u2009=\u20091.92; CI\u2009=\u20091.76, 2.10]. Conclusion There is low childbirth registration coverage in SSA. The predictors of this phenomenon are the child\u2019s age, maternal level of education, wealth index, place of residence, sub-region, maternal age, place of delivery, assistance during delivery, marital status, and sex of household head. Interventions and policies developed to improve childbirth registration coverage in SSA should prioritize mothers with no formal education, those who deliver at home, those with low socioeconomic status, those living in female headed household, and adolescent mothers.", "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1193816/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2047850878", "name": "R.

This was true of Ghana before a major registration campaign was undertaken.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nThis study, based on survey data, assesses the results of a registration campaign initiated in 2004-2005 in Ghana. Key strategies included: extending the legal period for free registration of infants; incorporating registration in child health promotion weeks; training community health workers to register births; using community registration volunteers; registering children during celebrations, and piloting community population registers. This paper discusses the contribution of these strategies to the increase in registration rates and shows the degree of association between birth registration and various health-care access indicators and family characteristics.\n\n\nLOCAL SETTING\nThe Ghana Births and Deaths Registry worked together with international organizations, mainly Plan International and the United Nations Children's Fund, to implement the birth registration campaign.\n\n\nRELEVANT CHANGES\nUnlike many other sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana saw a substantial rise in registration rates over the campaign period. Campaign strategies improved accessibility and shortened distance to registration centres. Survey data show that the registration rate for children younger than 5 years rose from 44% in 2003 to 71% in 2008.\n\n\nLESSONS LEARNT\nIncorporation of birth registration into community health care, health campaigns and mobile registration activities can reduce the indirect costs of birth registration, especially in poorer communities, and yield substantial increases in registration rates.

It accounts for approximately 40% of all childhood mortality in resource-poor countries. Each year, 7 million neonates globally are stillborn or dying within 30 days of birth (neonatal period). Reducing Neonatal mortality requires that interventions be readily accessible and available in the immediate perinatal period. Such countries have weak health metrics and systems, resulting in a paucity of perinatal and neonatal mortality information and a deficiency in quality of available data. Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and perinatal mortality rate (PMR), causes of death, and associated risk factors among hospital live births admitted to the NICU of Misurata teaching hospital in Libya. Methods: A descriptive, retrospective study based on hospital files records. From January 2013 to December 2013, information was collected from the registration book at labour room including operating theatre and newborn admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit of Misurata teaching hospital in Libya.

Stillbirth has wide-reaching consequences for parents, care providers, community and society at large. Purpose To assess the determinant of stillbirth among deliveries attended in Bale zone hospitals Southeast Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based unmatched case\u2013control study was conducted. Cases were deliveries whose birth outcome was stillbirth and controls were deliveries with live birth. A pretested and structured checklist was used to collect data from a sample of 402 (134 cases and 268 controls). Systematic random sampling was used to recruit samples from a list of charts in the delivery registration book. Data were entered into EpiData version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Crude and adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was calculated and P-value <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results A total of 402 charts of mothers (134 cases and 268 controls) were included in the analysis. Preceding birth interval <24 months (AOR: 2.991; 95%CI: 1.351\u20136.621), antenatal visit started at third trimester (AOR: 2.739; 95%CI: 1.048\u20137.158), referred from other health facility (AOR: 3.215; 95%CI: 1.430\u20137.229), labor length \u226524 h (AOR: 3.169; 95%CI: 1.241\u20138.091), presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR: 2.670; 95%CI: 1.082\u20136.592) and giving birth to a baby <2500 g (AOR: 3.155; 95%CI: 1.235\u20138.07) were determinants of stillbirth. Conclusion Preceding birth interval of <24 months, antenatal visit started at third trimester, referred from other health facility, presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid, labor length \u226424 h and giving birth to a baby <2500 g were found the determinants of stillbirth.

Nevertheless, the reliable measurement of mortality rates is the main barrier to reach this goal. Unfortunately, in many developing countries the vital registration system (VRS) is either defective or does not exist at all. Consequently, alternative methods have been developed to measure mortality. This study is a subcomponent of NASBOD project, which is currently conducting in Iran. In this study, we aim to calculate incompleteness of the Death Registration System (DRS) and then to estimate levels and trends of child and adult mortality using reliable methods.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn order to estimate mortality rates, first, we identify all possible data sources. Then, we calculate incompleteness of child and adult morality separately. For incompleteness of child mortality, we analyze summary birth history data using maternal age cohort and maternal age period methods. Then, we combine these two methods using LOESS regression. However, these estimates are not plausible for some provinces. We use additional information of covariates such as wealth index and years of schooling to make predictions for these provinces using spatio-temporal model. We generate yearly estimates of mortality using Gaussian process regression that covers both sampling and non-sampling errors within uncertainty intervals. By comparing the resulted estimates with mortality rates from DRS, we calculate child mortality incompleteness. For incompleteness of adult mortality, Generalized Growth Balance, Synthetic Extinct Generation and a hybrid of two mentioned methods are used. Afterwards, we combine incompleteness of three methods using GPR, and apply it to correct and adjust the number of deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this study, we develop a conceptual framework to overcome the existing challenges for accurate measuring of mortality rates. The resulting estimates can be used to inform policy-makers about past, current and future mortality rates as a major indicator of health status of a population.", "citationCount": 59, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "143631501", "name": "Y.

Low birth weight continues to remain a major public health problem related to poverty, social factors such as lower status of women, malnutrition, lack of anti-natal care, etc., in Ethiopia in contrast to what is observed in many developing countries. The objective of this study was to determine birth weight distribution and its association with some risk factors among newborns delivered in Metu Karl hospital Metu town (South-West Ethiopia) from February 2003 - February 2005.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross sectional retrospective study was conducted in the month of April 2005. Information collected includes variables such as: birth weight of neonates, maternal residence, maternal age, maternal occupational status, marital status, parity, history of antenatal care follow up, sex of the new born and season of delivery. Data was collected from the registration book and cards of the study subjects using preformed data collection format. The collected information was analyzed by SPSS computer statistical package at Jimma University.\n\n\nRESULT\nA total of 1832 singleton live births were included in the study. The over all prevalence of Low Birth Weight (LBW) was 8.6% and the overall mean birth weight was 3147gms where as for males and females it was 3265gm and 3007gms respectively. Sex of the newborn, antenatal care follow up and obstetric illness during the last pregnancy was significantly related to birth weight.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the results improving antenatal care, maternal and child health and family planning services, health education especially for reproductive age groups and appropriate record keeping systems were recommended.", "citationCount": 22, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "11511964", "name": "Gezahegn Nekatibeb"}, {"authorId": "116574044", "name": "Abebe G/mariam"}], "references": []}, {"paperId": "b766613b0af5c80c1880270d20393ee112d1c2a6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b766613b0af5c80c1880270d20393ee112d1c2a6", "title": "Generation of vital event notifications from DHIS2 for strengthening CRVS system", "abstract": "Vital events such as birth, death, marriage and divorce are recorded by the civil registration systems, and they are the major sources of national vital statistics. In most of the developing and under-developed countries, the civil registration and vital statistics systems are non-existent or weak. As a consequence, fertility, mortality and other key demographic information are not calculated from actual data on a continuous basis, these data are rather estimated through survey and do not cover large segments of the population. However, vital statistics data are important to any government for proper planning, resource allocation and development. Manual birth and death registrations is time-consuming and inconceivable for a large population. Information technology has already become an effective tool in the civil registration processes, but the registrar general office for birth and death has to depend on the health department as the birth and death events occur at hospitals and health care facilities. Survey results show that birth registration rate within 45 days of birth is very low and it is only around 3% in Bangladesh. In order to strengthen registration system, coordination between registration agency and health department is necessary and a notification for birth/death event should be reported to the registration agency for further action. To address this issue, we have designed a system that will send a notification to the registrar general office when a birth record is obtained in the health information system. In Bangladesh, the District Health Information System version 2 (DHIS2) is used in the health department for aggregated data collection and reporting purpose. Thus we studied DHIS2 system to see the feasibility of generating birth and death notifications upon collection of field data by the community health workers and designed and implemented necessary interfaces for the field worker, DHIS2 and Registrar general office. The system implementation was accomplished using MySQL as the back-end database and object oriented PHP as the application programming interface.", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "32867787", "name": "F.

Implicit in testing is the ability to document birth and neonatal outcomes in rural communities. The thesis sets perinatal events in the context of the child survival literature and critically examines current knowledge about practices, outcomes and interventions. This knowledge is found to be limited, particularly in terms of practices and outcomes in rural settings in developing countries. Methods: Two methods are described to document perinatal events in villages in Makwanpur district, Nepal. (1) a census of women of reproductive age, collecting information about previous pregnancies and most recent live births (2) a prospective system of registration that tracked women through childbirth and infants through the neonatal period. Both methods yielded information on pregnancies, birth outcomes, care practices and health care seeking patterns. Results: The census collected information from 12,170 women, of whom 4867 had given birth in the preceding two years. The prospective surveillance collected information on 3522 pregnancies over two years. The thesis presents results under two broad themes: (1) a description of the birth experience of women in rural Makwanpur, its outcomes, practices and care seeking patterns (2) a comparison of the two methods of data collection. Poverty was the norm in rural Makwanpur and only a quarter of participants were literate. 30% of pregnant women had any antenatal care, which tended to be both late and limited, and 95% gave birth at home. Three percent of women were helped by trained health workers and there were compromises in hygiene and warmth at the time of delivery. Breastfeeding rates were high. The prospective registration process suggested a neonatal mortality rate of 37 per thousand live births, a figure higher than that from the census (27 per thousand), and thus higher than would be estimated by existing methodologies. Discussion: Antenatal, delivery, postnatal and neonatal care practices and care seeking are compared with existing knowledge from other studies. Their implications for programmatic intervention are considered. The issue of recall-based data collection is discussed as it bears upon the evaluation of public health interventions. The feasibility of registration systems is assessed and recommendations made for increasing reliability, expansion and replication, and reducing system costs. 386 words.", "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "6205361", "name": "D.

Challenges in measuring MDG5 achievements", "abstract": "The last few years have seen an increasing demand for more accurate estimates to mark progress in development. In particular the widely acknowledged lack of progress in MDG 5 \u2013 improving maternal and reproductive health \u2013 has highlighted the importance of providing good and accurate estimates. As a result countries feel the pressure to improve their statistical systems and donors to increase their support to statistical offices. However estimation of the maternal mortality ratio, the key target for MDG5, is far from being accurate and in most developing countries we still rely on large confidence intervals while vital registration systems are far from being adequate. The paper will discuss the major shortcomings of the key target indicators: skilled birth attendance at delivery, maternal mortality ratio, antenatal care coverage and unmet need for family planning. I will review issues related to the availability, quality of data and their comparability, as well as new ways to estimate maternal mortality and the debate surrounding the suitability of unmet need as an indicator of reproductive health programme success. The paper will also highlight the challenges ahead when monitoring progress in terms of improvements in data collection and reporting to the\u00a0international agencies.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-25", "authors": [{"authorId": "48300373", "name": "Tiziana Leone"}], "references": [{"paperId": "2e3f007f83a52c63bee327859c3dde484d74b2d3", "title": "Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980\u20132008: a systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5"}, {"paperId": "5cf6434e1e486fed2fede9a177128d77ca02a0fd", "title": "Community factors affecting rising caesarean section rates in developing countries: an analysis of six countries."}, {"paperId": "7113b3b3c86a794130d2937942ed51c074a7df6f", "title": "On postponement and birth intervals."}, {"paperId": "4f0935c04d970690f0c6a0b026cdf182919f0dd3", "title": "The familial technique for linking maternal death with poverty"}, {"paperId": "9840054e9e0fdecba980a4a0632e6e0631b09a3b", "title": "A note on the sisterhood estimator of maternal mortality."}, {"paperId": "b2aee0bd4b741453505dbc8d0f6ee0a7eac5eb8a", "title": "Manual X: Indirect Techniques for Demographic Estimation"}, {"paperId": "e1f9584c9391fd1dab712fd2c4395674037d54a4", "title": "Further developments in indirect mortality estimation."}, {"paperId": "7fce20aea3011237436ccc8623155b2e45c8da0a", "title": "Maternal mortality in 2005 : estimates developed by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and the World Bank"}, {"paperId": "4aed6c47400ddd92e9f2d321d2caefac36a287ba", "title": "Maternal and Perinatal Conditions"}, {"paperId": "fab302682fbc2cff902c28fec70af949b99f554d", "title": "Maternal and Perinatal Conditions -- Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries"}, {"paperId": "9eb877a203630e47ded7b24b304871683f3e4c69", "title": "Every death counts: measurement of maternal mortality via a census."}, {"paperId": "af8cbd89203d936346e486197fb53ae95a63401a", "title": "Should eliminating unmet need for contraception continue to be a program priority"}, {"paperId": "85feadf22b006b54828cfdfd8f54caf9ef88994b", "title": "Some thoughts on ICPD+5."}, {"paperId": "173cbebee165be91b6d9a894d202c7d7e2928569", "title": "Reaching a stationary global population: what we have learnt, and what we must do."}]}, {"paperId": "e5e308ef39353895e46962c3e0309030cc157f58", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5e308ef39353895e46962c3e0309030cc157f58", "title": "Some indirect techniques to estimate maternal mortality in Nepal.", "abstract": "A mother sometimes loses her own life during the process of giving birth to a child. In most developing countries like Nepal childbearing is valued highly expected and an inevitable part of a womans life. Some key causes of maternal deaths in Nepal are hemorrhage sepsis toxemia obstructive labor and septic abortion etc. Due to less access to quality health care maternal mortality continues to be a leading cause of death during the reproduction process. It is difficult to know the maternal mortality level and trend in a country or in a community from the limited data available. Indirect techniques may be appropriate tool to diagnose such a situation. In fact an indirect method of estimation has its origin and produce estimates of certain parameters on the basis of information which is only related to its value (parameter) indirectly. Traditionally estimation of demographic parameters has been done on the basis of data collected by census or by vital registration system. Unfortunately however in many countries today the data collection by these systems either do not exist or their quality is so poor that estimates based on such data yield inconsistent results.

A birth certificate is proof of identity, citizenship and serves as a gateway to the realisation of other rights for children. It also serves as evidence that a child has been registered. Using evidence from the Tanzania National Panel Data 2010/11, I show that birth registration predicts lower odds for possessing a birth certificate for children in Tanzania. Instead, the education of the mother and the ability of households to pay for their own malaria bed nets, serve as the strongest predictors for possessing birth certificates in Tanzania. The article concludes with recommendations for improving birth registration and certification in Tanzania.", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-06-17", "authors": [{"authorId": "116506480", "name": "A.

So, given the extensive anticipated benefits of birth registration, there has been increasing interest from development organisations in implementing programmes on birth registration in countries with low rates of registration.But there is a significant lack of empirical research that explores the effects of birth registration, and if and how it benefits children in practice.Plan\u2019s new research in India, Kenya, Sierra Leone and Vietnam reveals the results of an investigation into the impact of birth registration. What emerges is a complex picture of the interrelationship between children\u2019s rights and birth registration.

Neben dem Insistieren auf dem in internationalen Konventionen zugesicherten Recht wird hierzu eine kausale Beziehung zwischen Geburtenregistrierung einerseits und sozialer Exklusion bzw. Inklusion andererseits betont. Die Idee, eine fehlende Registrierung intensiviere soziale Exklusion ist zu einer Art Mantra der Aktivist/innen geworden, ihr fehlt aber eine empirische Fundierung: Trotz Surveys, die in Zimbabwe und anderen Entwicklungslandern erhoben werden, fehlen Erhebungen, die das dynamische Zusammenspiel von Geburtenregistrierung und Exklusion/Inklusion nachzuvollziehen erlauben wurden. In diesem Beitrag versuche ich zu zeigen, in welcher Weise qualitative Sozialforschung helfen kann, diese Lucke zu schliesen und die Aktivitaten in Richtung einer umfassenden Geburtenregistrierung zu stutzen.

\n \nAbstract \n \nThe right to recognition as a person before the law is a fundamental right for all and recognized by various human rights instruments ; for example, Article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 7 of the Convention on Rights of Children. In practice, such right could be referred to the right to have a birth registration and the right to be recorded in the national population data. Particularly, the birth registration (Birth Registration for All) is the evidence that the state has acknowledged a child as a person before the state law and implemented the obligation under human rights law. The Committee on the Rights of the Child viewed that birth registration was a primary step to ensure the inherent right to life of a child and the right of a child to the survival and development Thailand respects this basic rights of a child by enforcing Civil Registration Act B.E. 2534 (amendment No.2) B.E. 2551 as a tool to recognize the legal status of every person. The government has developed a registration system being run by the Department of Provincial Administration under the Ministry of Interior. The system contains main documents, which are Birth Certificate, Household registration documents (Domicile certificate) and Death Certificate for a person born, domiciled and died within Thai territory or having a connecting point with the state under a territorial principle. The system is based on a non-discrimination principle with a difference in nationality or immigrant status. This action research uses a problem-based study approach by selecting and analyzing 10 legal cases where a child was not granted the right to recognition as a person before the law. The researcher has involved in providing legal aids and observed the law enforcement of the selected legal cases analyzed in this research. This research reflects that the problems are derived from a lack of legal knowledge on the right to recognition of a person before the law by the parents, regardless of the parent\u2019s legal status, and the problem of law enforcement by the responsible officials such delaying the process or ignoring an application. This research has been conducting a survey on a situation of the problem and makes recommendations based on the problem-based and legal clinical study. Some cases could be solved while in some cases a child remains the status as a stateless person.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-30", "authors": [{"authorId": "122476498", "name": "\u0e14\u0e23\u0e38\u0e13\u0e35 \u0e44\u0e1e\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e13\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e01\u0e38\u0e25"}], "references": []}, {"paperId": "abd4e928ab19f6fc7139b83cee09892c7f83a5e1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abd4e928ab19f6fc7139b83cee09892c7f83a5e1", "title": "Current Status of Birth Registration Practice in Nepal", "abstract": "Birth registration is an essential element of civil registration and vital statistics which provide a legal identity and recognize the rights of an individual. In Nepal, birth registration has a long history starting from the Village Panchayat Act 1962 which was the first act with a provision for a birth certificate. Despite the over half-century experience of birth registration efforts, challenges to universal birth certificate coverage remain present, especially among the rural population. This research will investigate the current practices of birth registration in Nepal based on the findings of the National Population and Housing Census 2021. The analysis will show respective rates of birth certificate issuance across the regions, provinces, and development districts. Some areas show remarkable success in birth registration, while others struggle to reach significant coverage levels. The experience shows the critical role of government responsiveness to the development of birth registration which is especially important for rural areas and districts with significant rural populations. In this light, targeted efforts and outreach campaigns are necessary to eliminate barriers, thus guaranteeing equal access to birth registration for all children in Nepal.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/bcja/article/download/65460/49653", "status": "HYBRID"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-05-09", "authors": [{"authorId": "2291299825", "name": "Rameshwor Kafle"}], "references": [{"paperId": "f82c3ea10c1355f02a76807b429a6690c794efca", "title": "Birth registration in Nepal: An assessment of progress based on two national surveys"}, {"paperId": "9500e22d66d6b67c1370cfb94b4f68c09b1c6828", "title": "Vital Registration System in Nepal"}, {"paperId": "14778b3a1d85d13d6a785239a041bdf0cbecc05e", "title": "Civil Registration and Vital Statistics as a Tool to Improve Public Management"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "Population Situation of Nepal"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "National Population and Housing Census, 2021: National Report"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "Status of civil registration and vital statistics in South Asia Countries"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "The Future for Women and Children: UNICEF and WHO Joint Statement on Strengthening Civil Registration and Vital Statistics"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "Legal analysis of civil registration laws of Nepal.

The main points of the proposed legislation can be summarized as follows: \nOn the biological father\u2019s rights to deny paternity: \n1. \u24b6 Within 2 years from the date of the child\u2019s birth, or \u24b7 within 1 year from the date the plaintiff discovers that he is the biological father, provided there is no social parenthood between the legal father and the child, and if the adult child consents to the denial themselves, the biological father may file for the denial of paternity against the legal father and the child/the mother with parental authority. \n2. Although the above requirements are met, the court may dismiss the biological father\u2019s request for denial of paternity if such denial significantly harms or is likely to harm the welfare of the child. \n3. Any person who files for denial of paternity while aware that he is not the biological father will be subject to criminal punishment. \nOn the provisional birth registration by biological father of the child: \n1. The biological father who has already filed for denial of paternity may apply for a provisional birth registration listing himself as the father of the registered child, by attaching test results conducted through scientific methods proving that he is the biological father. \n2. A provisional birth registration has the same effect as a formal one, except for matters regarding the child's legal father. Even if a provisional birth registration is made listing himself as the father of the registered child, the child\u2019s legal father remains the mother\u2019s husband until the court\u2019s judgment denying the presumed paternity of the husband, and confirming the biological father's acknowledgment of his paternity is finalized. \n3. Upon finalization of the judgment in the lawsuit filed by the biological father for denying paternity, or termination of the legal proceedings for other reasons, the legal father and mother responsible for the birth registration, and the biological father who applied for the provisional birth registration are obligated to correct the provisional birth registration in accordance with the final judgment or parental law.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-30", "authors": [{"authorId": "2296291308", "name": "Joon-kyu Choi"}], "references": []}, {"paperId": "011088f042091f4f2502daaa9bad90ba028b7cc5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/011088f042091f4f2502daaa9bad90ba028b7cc5", "title": "A rapid realist review of patient engagement in patient-oriented research and health care system impacts: part one", "abstract": null, "citationCount": 29, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40900-021-00299-6", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-10", "authors": [{"authorId": "5928994", "name": "E.

Two studies combined exome sequencing results for over 50,000 people with their electronic health records. Dewey et al. found that \u223c3.5% of individuals in their cohort had clinically actionable genetic variants. Many of these variants affected blood lipid levels that could influence cardiovascular health. Abul-Husn et al. extended these findings to investigate the genetics and treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, within their patient pool. Genetic screening helped identify at-risk patients who could benefit from increased treatment. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaf6814, p. 10.1126/science.aaf7000 Genomic screening can prompt the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia patients, the majority of whom are receiving inadequate lipid-lowering therapy. INTRODUCTION Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a public health genomics priority but remains underdiagnosed and undertreated despite widespread cholesterol screening. This represents a missed opportunity to prevent FH-associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pathogenic variants in three genes (LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9) account for the majority of FH cases. We assessed the prevalence and clinical impact of FH-associated genomic variants in 50,726 individuals from the MyCode Community Health Initiative at Geisinger Health System who underwent exome sequencing as part of the DiscovEHR human genetics collaboration with the Regeneron Genetics Center. RATIONALE Genetic testing for FH is uncommon in clinical practice in the United States, and the prevalence of FH variants in U.S. populations has not been well established. We sought to evaluate FH prevalence in a large integrated U.S. health care system using genomic sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data. We determined the impact of FH variants on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. We assessed the likelihood of FH variant carriers achieving a presequencing EHR-based FH diagnosis according to established clinical diagnostic criteria. Finally, we examined the rates of statin medication use and outcomes in FH variant carriers. RESULTS Thirty-five known and predicted pathogenic variants in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 were identified in 229 individuals. The estimated FH prevalence was 1:256 in unselected participants and 1:118 in participants ascertained via the cardiac catheterization laboratory. FH variants were found in only 2.5% of individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia (maximum EHR-documented LDL-C \u2265 190 mg/dl) in the cohort, and a maximum LDL-C of \u2265190 mg/dl was absent in 45% of FH variant carriers. Overall, FH variant carriers had 69 \u00b1 3 mg/dl greater maximum LDL-C than sequenced noncarriers (P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221220) and had significantly increased odds of general and premature CAD [odds ratio (OR), 2.6 (P = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221211) and 3.7 (P = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u221214), respectively]. The increased odds of general and premature CAD were most pronounced in carriers of LDLR predicted loss-of-function variants [OR, 5.5 (P = 7.7 \u00d7 10\u221213) and 10.3 (P = 9.8 \u00d7 10\u221219), respectively]. Fourteen FH variant carriers were deceased; chart review revealed that none of these individuals had a clinical diagnosis of FH. Before genetic testing, only 15% of FH variant carriers had an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) diagnosis code for pure hypercholesterolemia or had been seen in a lipid clinic, suggesting that few had been previously diagnosed with FH. Retrospectively applying Dutch Lipid Clinic Network diagnostic criteria to EHR data, we found presequencing criteria supporting a probable or definite clinical diagnosis of FH in 24% of FH variant carriers, highlighting the limitations of using existing clinical criteria for EHR-based screening in the absence of genetic testing. Active statin use was identified in 58% and high-intensity statin use in 37% of FH variant carriers. Only 46% of carriers currently on statin therapy had a most recent LDL-C level below 100 mg/dl compared to 77% of noncarriers. CONCLUSION In summary, we show that large-scale genomic screening in patients with longitudinal EHR data has the ability to detect FH, uncover and characterize novel pathogenic variants, determine disease prevalence, and enhance overall knowledge of clinical impact and outcomes. The 1:256 prevalence of FH variants in this predominantly European-American cohort is in line with prevalence estimates from recent work in European cohorts. Our findings highlight the undertreatment of FH variant carriers and demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for large-scale sequencing initiatives in service of precision medicine. Prevalence and clinical impact of FH variants in a large U.S. clinical care cohort. (A) Distribution of 229 heterozygous carriers of an FH variant in the DiscovEHR cohort by FH gene. (B) Prevalence of an FH variant in the DiscovEHR cohort and according to recruitment site. (C) Prevalence of an FH variant among individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C \u2265 190 mg/dl). (D) Statin treatment rates and outcomes in FH variant carriers and noncarriers. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) remains underdiagnosed despite widespread cholesterol screening. Exome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data of 50,726 individuals were used to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of FH-associated genomic variants in the Geisinger Health System. The estimated FH prevalence was 1:256 in unselected participants and 1:118 in participants ascertained via the cardiac catheterization laboratory. FH variant carriers had significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease. Only 24% of carriers met EHR-based presequencing criteria for probable or definite FH diagnosis. Active statin use was identified in 58% of carriers; 46% of statin-treated carriers had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level below 100 mg/dl. Thus, we find that genomic screening can prompt the diagnosis of FH patients, most of whom are receiving inadequate lipid-lowering therapy.", "citationCount": 356, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-23", "authors": [{"authorId": "1398299844", "name": "N.

Data analysis was performed January 2020 to January 2022.\n\n\nInterventions\nPrimary care clinicians were offered training in melanoma identification through skin examination and encouraged to offer annual screening to patients 35 years and older.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThickness of melanomas diagnosed in screened and unscreened patients.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 595\u202f799 analyzed screen-eligible patients, 144\u202f851 (24.3%) were screened at least once. Screened patients were older (median [IQR] age, 59 [49-67] vs 55 [45-66] years) and more likely to be female (82\u202f244 [56.8%] vs 250\u202f806 [55.6%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and non-Hispanic White (124\u202f747 [86.1%] vs 375\u202f890 [83.4%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) than unscreened patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and race, screened patients were more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with in situ (incidence, 30.4 vs 14.4; hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1; P\u2009<\u2009.001) or thin invasive (\u22641 mm) melanoma (incidence, 24.5 vs 16.1; HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Screened patients were also more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with in situ (incidence, 26.7 vs 12.9; HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001) or thin invasive (\u22641 mm) interval melanomas (melanoma diagnosed at least 60 days after initial screening examination) (incidence, 18.5 vs 14.4; HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Incidence of melanoma thicker than 4 mm in unscreened and screened patients, respectively, was 3.3 and 2.7 (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4; P\u2009=\u2009.38) for all melanomas and 2.7 and 1.5 (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2-1.2; P\u2009=\u2009.15) for interval melanomas.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this quality improvement study, primary care-based melanoma screening was associated with increased detection of thin melanoma, raising concern about overdiagnosis. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the influence of screening on the incidence of thick melanoma and outcomes associated with high costs and poor outcomes, such as metastasis.", "citationCount": 34, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2790694/jamadermatology_matsumoto_2022_oi_220008_1652203164.25796.pdf", "status": "CLOSED"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-06", "authors": [{"authorId": "46830318", "name": "Martha Matsumoto"}, {"authorId": "2122686856", "name": "Sarah Wack"}, {"authorId": "5477262", "name": "M.

Individuals with hearing loss report communication breakdowns, inaccessible health information, reduced awareness and training by health care providers, and decreased satisfaction while struggling with inadequate health literacy. These all contribute to health inequities and increased health care expenditures and inefficiencies. It is time to reframe the health care system for these individuals using existing models of best practices and accessibility to mitigate inequities and improve quality of care. Method: A review of system-, clinic-, provider-, and patient-level barriers, along with existing and suggested efforts to improve care for individuals with hearing loss, are presented. Results: These strategies include improving screening and identification of hearing loss, adopting universal design and inclusion principles, implementing effective communication approaches, leveraging assistive technologies and training, and diversifying a team to better care for patients with hearing loss. Patients should also be encouraged to seek social support and resources from hearing loss organizations while leveraging technologies to help facilitate communication. Conclusions: The strategies described introduce actionable steps that can be made at the system, clinic, provider, and patient levels. With implementation of these steps, significant progress can be made to more proactively meet the needs of patients with hearing loss.

Health care\u2013associated infections (HAIs) and drug-resistant pathogens have become a major health care issue with millions of reported cases every year. Advanced diagnostics would allow clinicians to more quickly determine the most effective treatment, reduce the nonspecific use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and facilitate enrollment in new antibiotic treatments. We present a new integrated system, polarization anisotropy diagnostics (PAD), for rapid detection of HAI pathogens. The PAD uses changes of fluorescence anisotropy when detection probes recognize target bacterial nucleic acids. The technology is inherently robust against environmental noise and economically scalable for parallel measurements. The assay is fast (2 hours) and performed on-site in a single-tube format. When applied to clinical samples obtained from interventional procedures, the PAD determined the overall bacterial burden, differentiated HAI bacterial species, and identified drug resistance and virulence status. The PAD system holds promise as a powerful tool for near-patient, rapid HAI testing.", "citationCount": 44, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/2/5/e1600300.full.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "145823925", "name": "K.

One of the most important directions in the development of health care in the Russian Federation is the improvement of approaches to maintaining the health of workers. In order to achieve this aim measures are being taken to prevent the development of occupational diseases, ensure the proper quality and availability of medical care in the occupational medicine and the staffing of medical organizations. Particular attention is paid to preventive measures, a healthy lifestyle and its promotion, and the identification of early signs of occupational diseases. The aim of the article is to determine perspective directions for the development of the health care system for workers with harmful (or) hazardous factors and working conditions, including an analysis of volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity as well as existing and developing legal acts regulating medical care for occupational medicine. Materials and methods. The legal acts regulating the health care of the workers, data from scientific research and scientific publications, statistical reports (form No. 30 \"Information about the medical organization\"; reporting materials of occupational medicine centers of the Russia's federal constituent entities) for the period 2016-2020 were studied and analyzed. Results. Today measures to improve the legal regulation of the health care of workers are one of the priority tasks of the state. Medical activity in the health of workers consists in carrying out preventive measures (determining a list of harmful and(or) dangerous production factors and work during the performance of which mandatory preliminary medical examinations are carried out upon admission to work and periodic medical examinations; a special assessment of working conditions; mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations), examinations of professional suitability, examinations of the connection between the disease and the occupation; medical care in occupational medicine; medical rehabilitation for medical reasons, medical and social expertise, social rehabilitation, spa and sanatorium treatment. In accordance with statistical data 654 occupational pathologists worked in the Russian Federation in 2020. In medical organizations 1961 full-time positions of occupational pathologists were organized, while the number of occupied positions was 1311, i. e. the staffing of occupational pathologists was 66.8%. A downward trend in the staffing of medical organizations with occupational pathologists has been noted over the past few years. Only 18.2% of all occupational pathologists had the highest category; 74% of occupational pathologists do not have a qualification category. The insufficient level of staffing and qualification of occupational pathologists has led to an increase in the burden on doctors and a decrease in the quality of preventive, therapeutic and diagnostic measures. The number of persons subjected to mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations amounted to 8.9 and 9.5 million people in 2018 and 2019 respectively. 7.43 million people were subject to inspections in 2020. The proportion of those examined within 3 years (from 2018 to 2020) remains at the same level and ranges from 98.2 to 98.6%. The share of examined persons with temporary/permanent medical contraindications to work in 2019 and 2020 did not change and amounted to 1.4%. In 2018 this index was 1.8%. At the same time the volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity in occupational medicine are poorly understood because occupational diseases are not socially significant and they are not recorded in the Unified State Health Information System. In this regard it is advisable to optimize approaches to statistical analysis: take into account the volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity in the system of protecting the health of workers including examinations of professional suitability and examinations of the connection between the disease and the occupation, mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations. Limitations. The study examined the results of a limited number of statistical forms. Conclusion. The regulatory legal acts in the Russian Federation makes it possible to provide workers with high-quality and affordable medical care. Currently, serious work is underway to modernize the legal acts regulating the protection of the health of workers in order to save the health of workers and their efficiency by obtaining and analyzing objective information sufficient to develop evidence-based tactical and strategic management decisions for the prevention of professional, professionally conditioned and general morbidity, reducing disability due to occupational diseases, reducing labor losses due to illness, maintaining working longevity. Volumetric and structural indicators of medical activity in occupational medicine are currently little studied, in this regard it is advisable to optimize approaches to statistical analysis. Special attention should be paid to the quality of staffing of medical organizations: the quality of continuous professional education of occupational pathologists. It is advisable to continue work to increase the availability of medical care in occupational medicine and the effectiveness of organizing mandatory medical examinations including telemedicine technologies and mobile medical teams. Mandatory medical examinations of workers must be carried out including using technical means and medical devices that provide automated remote transmission of information about the health status of workers and remote monitoring of their health status.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened this issue. Psychosocial peer-support programs that address general distress and are tailored to health care systems are needed. A Care for Caregivers (CFC) Program was developed at an American metropolitan university hospital and outpatient health care system. The CFC program trains \u201cPeer Caregivers\u201d and managers and has four components: the identification of colleagues in need of support; psychological first aid; linkage to resources; and the promotion of hope among colleagues experiencing demoralization. Qualitative interviews (n = 18) were conducted with Peer Caregivers and Managers participating in the initial piloting of the program. Results suggest that the CFC program shifts the organizational culture, teaches staff skills for recognizing and supporting others in distress, and supports those staff who are already providing these services informally. Findings suggest that staff distress resulted primarily from external factors and secondarily from internal organizational stressors. External stressors were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the program has promise for addressing staff burnout, other organizational efforts are needed to simultaneously promote staff wellness. Ultimately, psychosocial peer support programs for health care workers are feasible and potentially impactful, but also require other systemic changes within a health care system to improve and sustain staff well-being.", "citationCount": 17, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/5/4536/pdf?version=1678271349", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "5009561", "name": "L.

Methods The faith-based organization Sant\u2019Egidio supported the inauguration of secondary birth registration centres within seven health centres in R\u00e9o from July 2015 and four health centres in Godyr from February 2015, at which delivery and vaccination services were available. We calculated the number of timely registrations per 1000 population before and after the launch of the intervention in both the intervention and control municipalities. We used a logistic regression model to evaluate the probability of non-registration as a function of the health centre services used and various demographic and health characteristics, obtained through health registers data and interviews. Findings Compared with the previous 12 months, the number of timely birth registrations in R\u00e9o and Godyr rose from 502 to 2094 (317.1%) and from 267 to 793 (197.0%) during the first 12 months of the intervention. In the two control municipalities, the numbers were unchanged. Infants whose mothers attended health centres for delivery, but did not return for vaccinations, had the lowest proportions of birth registration (69.0%; 294/426; in R\u00e9o and 70.2%; 40/57 in Godyr). Infants of mothers who were not interviewed were more likely to not having a timely birth registration (in R\u00e9o odds ratio, OR: 6.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 4.10\u20139.52 and in Godyr OR: 25.64; 95% CI: 4.31\u2013166.67).

We aimed to determine if prior HPV vaccination reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA New Zealand population-based retrospective study linking first pregnancy outcome data (2008-2014 n\u202f=\u202f35,646) with prior quadrivalent HPV vaccination status. Primary outcomes were likelihood (odds ratios, ORs) of PTB, pre-eclampsia, and stillbirth. Exposure groups were based on HPV vaccination. Adjusted ORs were calculated for each outcome, controlling for mother's age at delivery, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health board region at time of delivery, and body mass index and smoking status at time of registration with maternity care provider.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMother's mean age at delivery was 19 (SD 2.1) years. Of 34,994 the pregnancies included in the final study analyses 62.3% of women were unvaccinated, 11.0% vaccinated with one or two doses and 27.7% vaccinated with three doses prior to pregnancy. PTB (OR: 0.87; CI 0.78, 0.96)) was significantly lower for women who previously received the HPV vaccine. A dose response effect was found with each successive dose received decreasing the likelihood of PTB. No associations between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were shown for pre-eclampsia or stillbirth.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrior receipt of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was associated with a significant reduction in PTB (13%); suggesting that HPV vaccination may be effective in reducing PTB. The potential global public health impact is considerable and there is urgency to undertake further research to replicate and explore these findings.", "citationCount": 14, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jpc.13882_73", "status": "BRONZE"}, "publicationTypes": ["Study", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-01-02", "authors": [{"authorId": "145466091", "name": "B.

A cluster-randomised trial in Guinea-Bissau", "abstract": "Objective To assess the effect of providing BCG and oral polio vaccine (OPV) at an early home visit after delivery. Design Cluster-randomised trial, randomising 92 geographically defined clusters 1:1 to intervention/control arms. Setting Bandim Health Project Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Guinea-Bissau. Participants 2226 newborns enrolled between July 2016 and August 2019. Interventions In both arms, newborns received a home visit within 72 hours after birth. In intervention clusters (n=46), BCG and OPV were provided at the home visit. Main outcome measure Rates of non-accidental mortality were compared in Cox proportional hazards models from (last of) day 1 or enrolment, until (first of) day 60 or registration of non-trial vaccines. Results A total of 35 deaths (intervention: 7, control: 28) were registered during the trial. Providing BCG and OPV reduced non-accidental early infant mortality by 59% (8\u201382%). The intervention also reduced non-accidental hospital admissions. The intervention had little impact on growth and BCG scarring and tended to increase the risk of consultations. Conclusions The trial was stopped early due to lower-than-expected enrolment and event rates when 33% of the planned number of newborns had been enrolled. Despite the small size of the trial, the results support that early BCG and OPV vaccinations are beneficial and reduce early child mortality and morbidity.

Designing an effective vaccination programme for RSV requires information about the relative contribution of risk factors for severe RSV symptoms. Aim To inform preventive strategies in Europe by quantifying the contribution of key child, family and health service risk factors to the burden of RSV hospital admissions in young children. Methods We constructed a birth cohort study of all singleton children born in Scotland between October 2009 and September 2012 using linkage between birth registration, maternity, vaccination and hospital admission records, with follow-up until the age of 3 years. RSV-confirmed hospital admissions were defined using linkage to national laboratory surveillance data. We estimated hospital admission rates per 1,000 child years and length of stay according to each risk factor. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. Results There were 5,185 RSV admissions among the 169,726 children in the cohort: 48.6% of admissions occurred before the age of 6 months, and 29.6% after the age of 1 year. Children born prematurely, small for gestational age, between July and December, with chronic conditions, older siblings, mothers\u2009<\u200930 years old or delayed infant vaccination had a significantly increased risk of admission. Minimising the risk posed by older siblings could reduce RSV admissions by up to 34%. Conclusion Future RSV vaccination programmes must protect children throughout early childhood. Vaccination and/or interventions to reduce transmission by older siblings could substantially reduce RSV hospital admissions.", "citationCount": 42, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.eurosurveillance.org/deliver/fulltext/eurosurveillance/24/1/eurosurv-24-1-2.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2F10.2807%2F1560-7917.ES.2019.24.1.1800046&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/eurosurveillance", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-01-03", "authors": [{"authorId": "4619720", "name": "P.

"abstract": "By using linked nationwide registry data from Denmark, we characterize the impacts of birth season and birth year on patterns of antibiotic prescribing during infancy. OBJECTIVES: We examined 2 birth cohort effects on antibiotic prescribing during the first year of life (henceforth, infancy) in Denmark: (1) the birth season effect on timing and overall occurrence of antibiotic prescribing, and (2) the birth year effect amid emerging nationwide pneumococcal vaccination programs and changing prescribing guidelines. METHODS: We linked data for all live births in Denmark from 2004 to 2012 (N = 561\u2009729) across the National Health Service Prescription Database, Medical Birth Registry, and Civil Registration System. Across birth season and birth year cohorts, we estimated 1-year risk, rate, and burden of redeemed antibiotic prescriptions during infancy. We used interrupted time series methods to assess prescribing trends across birth year cohorts. Graphical displays of all birth cohort effect data are included. RESULTS: The 1-year risk of having at least 1 redeemed antibiotic prescription during infancy was 39.5% (99% confidence interval [CI]: 39.3% to 39.6%). The hazard of a first prescription increased with age throughout infancy and varied by season; subsequently, Kaplan-Meier\u2013derived risk functions varied by birth season cohort. After rollout of a first vaccination program and new antibiotic prescribing guidelines, 1-year risk decreased by 4.4% over 14 months (99% CI: 3.4% to 5.5%); it decreased again after rollout of a second vaccination program by 6.9% over 3 years (99% CI: 4.4% to 9.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, birth season and birth year cohort effects influenced timing and risk of antibiotic prescribing during infancy. Future studies of antibiotic stewardship, effectiveness, and safety in children should consider these cohort effects, which may render some children inherently more susceptible than others to downstream antibiotic effects.", "citationCount": 33, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/140/3/e20170441.full.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-08-14", "authors": [{"authorId": "4876568", "name": "Alan C.

An impact evaluation study has been designed, comparing the two study districts with two comparable control districts. Retrospective and current data are collected from civil registers and health registers for delivery and vaccination. The study aims at investigating the determinants that are associated with the increase of civil birth registrations. At the moment individual data collected in the 12 months of implementation of the program in the two study districts have been recorded. Preliminary results show that: The number of birth certificates have increased extremely compared to the previous year; The proportions of minor mothers and single mothers have increased; The percentages of registered children vary among centers; Performances are much higher among children born in the health facilities compared to children only vaccinated there.

This study investigates changes and socioeconomic inequalities in early birth registration and indicators of care and education in children aged under 5 years in Vietnam. Design The analyses reported here used data from the Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) in 2006 and 2011. The sample sizes in 2006 and 2011 were 2,680 and 3,678 for children under 5 years of age. Four indicators of childcare and preschool education were measured: birth registration, possession of books, preschool education attendance, and parental support for early childhood education. The concentration index (CI) was used to measure inequalities in gender, maternal education, geographical area, place of residence, ethnicity, and household wealth. Results There were some improvements in birth registration (86.4% in 2006; 93.8% in 2011), preschool education attendance (57.1% in 2006; 71.9% in 2011), and parental support for early childhood education (68.9 and 76.8%, respectively). However, the possession of books was lower (24.7% in 2006; 19.6% in 2011) and became more unequal over time (i.e. CI=0.370 in 2006; CI=0.443 in 2011 in wealth inequality). Inequalities in the care and education of children were still persistent. The largest inequalities were for household wealth and rural versus urban areas. Conclusion Although there have been some improvements in this area, inequalities still exist. Policy efforts in Vietnam should be directed towards closing the gap between different socioeconomic groups for the care and education of children under 5 years old.", "citationCount": 8, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/gha.v9.29470?needAccess=true", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-29", "authors": [{"authorId": "5746543", "name": "K.

Inequities in birth registration completeness become apparent when examined by wealth, urban/rural location, geographical region, maternal education, healthcare utilisation, and marital status. Child age, maternal education, marital status, household wealth status, residence, province, and delivery place were significant predictors of birth registration.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), birth registration rates remain low, with millions of children going unregistered each year. Understanding the predictors of birth registration among children in this sub-region is important for developing targeted interventions to improve registration rates. The study examines the predictors of birth registration among children in SSA. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of secondary data pooled from the Demographic and Health Survey of 17 countries conducted from 2015 to 2021. A weighted sample of 162,500 children was included in the final analysis. We summarized the proportion of birth registration among children in SSA using a forest plot. We utilized a multilevel binary logistic regression analysis to examine the predictors of birth registration. The results were presented using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results We found that 48.32% [48.15\u201348.49] of births in SSA were registered. The lowest and highest prevalence of birth registration were found in Ethiopia (2.70 [2.38\u20133.02]) and Sierra Leone (92.93 [92.36\u201393.50]), respectively. Increasing child\u2019s age was found to be significantly associated with a higher likelihood of birth registrations, with those aged 4 years [aOR\u2009=\u20091.55; CI\u2009=\u20091.49, 1.62] having the highest odds of birth registration compared to those aged below 1 year. Children born to mothers with primary [aOR\u2009=\u20091.17; CI\u2009=\u20091.11, 1.24], secondary [aOR\u2009=\u20091.44; CI\u2009=\u20091.34, 1.54], and higher education [aOR\u2009=\u20091.71; CI\u2009=\u20091.48, 1.99] were more likely to be registered than those born to mothers who had no formal education. Also, children born in health facilities were more likely to be registered [aOR\u2009=\u20091.60; CI\u2009=\u20091.48, 1.74] than those born at home. The odds of birth registration were significantly higher among children whose mothers received assistance during delivery [aOR\u2009=\u20091.88; CI\u2009=\u20091.72, 2.04], those in the richest wealth index [aOR\u2009=\u20093.91; CI\u2009=\u20093.54, 4.33], and those in rural areas [aOR\u2009=\u20091.92; CI\u2009=\u20091.76, 2.10]. Conclusion There is low childbirth registration coverage in SSA. The predictors of this phenomenon are the child\u2019s age, maternal level of education, wealth index, place of residence, sub-region, maternal age, place of delivery, assistance during delivery, marital status, and sex of household head. Interventions and policies developed to improve childbirth registration coverage in SSA should prioritize mothers with no formal education, those who deliver at home, those with low socioeconomic status, those living in female headed household, and adolescent mothers.", "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1193816/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "2047850878", "name": "R.

A birth certificate is proof of identity, citizenship and serves as a gateway to the realisation of other rights for children. It also serves as evidence that a child has been registered. Using evidence from the Tanzania National Panel Data 2010/11, I show that birth registration predicts lower odds for possessing a birth certificate for children in Tanzania. Instead, the education of the mother and the ability of households to pay for their own malaria bed nets, serve as the strongest predictors for possessing birth certificates in Tanzania.

To gain insight into the reasons behind this low registration rate, we study the role of determinants at the household, sub-national regional and country level, using self-reported birth registration data on 358,842 children in 40 SSA countries. While most of the variation in reported birth registration is due to factors at the household level, context factors are found to play an important role as well. At the household level, poverty, low education, restricted autonomy of women, and belonging to a traditional religion are associated with lower odds of being registered. Lack of professional care during pregnancy, delivery, and early life also decrease the odds of being registered. Important factors at the context level are the average number of prenatal care visits in the local area, living in an urban area, the kind of birth registration legislation, decentralization of the registration system, fertility rates, and the number of conflicts. To improve registration, the complex dynamics of these factors at the household and context level have to be taken into account.", "citationCount": 6, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265882&type=printable", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-08", "authors": [{"authorId": "123160454", "name": "A.

About 2.7 million children under age five years do not have official birth registration document in India. Unavailability of birth registration document may deprive the children from access to government-aided essential services such as fixed years of formal education, healthcare, and legal protection. This study examines the effect of socioeconomic, demographic and health care factors on birth registration in India. We also examined the spatial pattern of completeness of birth registration that could be useful for district level intervention. Methods We used data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015\u201316. We carried out the descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis. Besides, we used multilevel binary logistic regression to identify significant covariates of birth registration at the individual, district, and state levels. We used GIS software to do spatial mapping of completeness of birth registration at district level. Results The birth registration level was lower than national average (80.21%) in the 254 districts. In Uttar Pradesh, 12 out of 71 districts recorded lower than 50% birth registration. Also, some districts from Arunachal Pradesh, J&K, and Rajasthan recorded lower than 50% birth registration. We also found a lower proportion of children are registered among children of birth order three and above (62.83%) and rural resident (76.62%). Children of mothers with no formal education, no media exposure, poorest wealth quintile, OBC and muslims religion have lower level of birth registration. Multilevel regression result showed 25 percent variation in birth registration lie between states while the remaining 75 percent variation lie within states.

It draws on a mixture of academic and grey literature, in particular reports by international development organizations. While there is extensive literature on rates of birth registration and the barriers to this, and consensus on approaches to promote registration, the review found less evidence of measures specifically aimed at marginalised groups. Gender issues are addressed to some extent, particularly in understanding barriers to registration, but the literature was largely disability-blind. The literature notes that birth registration is considered as a fundamental human right, allowing access to services such as healthcare and education; it is the basis for obtaining other identity documents, e.g. driving licenses and passports; it protects children, e.g. from child marriage; and it enables production of vital statistics to support government planning and resource allocation. Registration rates are generally lower than average for vulnerable children, e.g. from minority groups, migrants, refugees, children with disabilities. Discriminatory policies against minorities, restrictions on movement, lack of resources, and lack of trust in government are among the \u2018additional\u2019 barriers affecting the most marginalised. Women, especially unmarried women, also face greater challenges in getting births registered. General approaches to promoting birth registration include legal and policy reform, awareness-raising activities, capacity building of registration offices, integration of birth registration with health services/education/social safety nets, and the use of digital technology to increase efficiency and accessibility.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/20.500.12413/16747/1/988_Increasing_birth_registration_for_children_from_marginalised_groups_in_Pakistan.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-16", "authors": [{"authorId": "48922884", "name": "I.

The object of the study was public relations violated by crimes of corruption. The subject of the study was the basic concepts of anti-corruption legislation, their relationship, measures and methods of combating corruption, which can ensure the safety of society from corruption crimes. The theoretical basis of the study was the conceptual provisions and views of criminologists. During the research process, both general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, description, systematization, induction, comparison and dialectical method) and specific scientific methods (formal legal and systemic) were used. The purpose of the study was the features and trends of corruption crime, the correlation of the main categories used in anti-corruption legislation, and the identification of criminological measures to combat corruption-related crime. To achieve the purpose of the study, the following tasks were solved: the current legislation in terms of combating corruption was analyzed; the current measures to minimize corruption offenses were studied. Such categories of anti-corruption legislation as \u201cprevention of corruption\u201d, \u201cprevention of corruption\u201d, \u201csuppression of corruption crimes\u201d, \u201csystemic corruption\u201d were subjected to critical analysis. The study of the issue of corruption led to the conclusion that the terms used by the legislator require improvement. The study of the main categories associated with corruption crime helped to identify characteristics characteristic of this phenomenon. The result of the work was the identification of comprehensive preventive measures for corruption based on its characteristic features.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.47475/2311-696x-2023-39-4-211-215", "status": "BRONZE"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-29", "authors": [{"authorId": "2037963876", "name": "O.

High level of corruption offences badly hits the prestige of the country and reduces the level of trust in government. One of the hardest spheres in terms of combating corruption is the banking sector, because the banking system collides with the most complicated forms of corruption. It is the fact that banking assets in monetary terms are close to the country's GDP, which potentially makes the banking sector attractive to corrupt officials. In this regard, the study of the specifics of the occurrence of corruption risks in the banking sector, as well as strategies and approaches to their elimination, requires thorough checks in all its areas of activity. Drawing up an effective strategy will significantly minimize the risks of corruption and achieve more transparent and efficient banking sector, which in the future, of course, will affect the quality of the services provided by the bank. Therefore, the strategy of building an effective banking sector should be a priority for developing countries, because these countries more often face with corruption risks.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2101008928", "name": "Kirill Antropov"}, {"authorId": "88812502", "name": "R.

Cargo owners and cargo forwarders have been particularly concerned about long delays in the processing and clearing of cargo at border posts. Field studies suggest that these delays are due to a combination of factors, such as a lack of optimum system configurations and non-optimised human-dependent operations, which make the operations prone to corruption and other malpractices. Objectives: This article presents possible strategies for improving some of the operations in this sector. The research hinges on two key questions: (1) what is the impact of information interchange between stakeholders on the cargo transit time and (2) how will cargo transit time be impacted upon by automatic identification of cargo and the status of cargo seals on arriving vehicles at the border? Method: The use of information communication systems enabled by automatic identification systems (incorporating radio-frequency identification technology) is suggested. Results: Results obtained by the described simulation model indicate that improvements of up to 82% with regard to transit time are possible using these techniques. Conclusion: The findings therefore demonstrate how operations at border posts can be improved through the use of appropriate technology and configuration of the operations.", "citationCount": 3, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jtscm.co.za/index.php/jtscm/article/download/181/383", "status": "GOLD"}, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2015-11-04", "authors": [{"authorId": "2334133409", "name": "Ernest Bhero"}, {"authorId": "2968872", "name": "A.

An adversary uses such attacks to overwrite credential information, thereby overcoming security features through arbitrary program execution. CPU features such as Supervisor Mode Access Prevention, Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention and the No eXecute bit facilitate access permission control and data execution in virtual memory. Additionally, Linux reduces actual attacks through kernel vulnerability affects via several protection methods including Kernel Address Space Lay-out Randomization, Control Flow Integrity, and Kernel Page Table Isolation. Although the combination of these methods can mitigate attacks as kernel vulnerability relies on the interaction between the user and the kernel modes, kernel virtual memory corruption can still occur (e.g., the eBPF vulnerability allows malicious memory overwriting only in the kernel mode). We present the Kernel Memory Observer (KMO), which has a secret observation mechanism to monitor kernel virtual memory. KMO is an alternative design for virtual memory can detect illegal data manipulation / writing in the kernel virtual memory. KMO determines kernel virtual memory corruption, inspects system call arguments, and forcibly unmaps the direct mapping area. An evaluation of KMO reveals that it can detect kernel virtual memory corruption that contains the defeating security feature through actual kernel vulnerabilities. In addition, the results indicate that the system call overhead latency ranges from 0.002 \u00b5 s to 8.246 \u00b5 s, and the web application benchmark ranges from 39.70 \u00b5 s to 390.52 \u00b5 s for each HTTP access, whereas KMO reduces these overheads by using tag-based Translation Lookaside Bu \ufb00 ers.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"],

The user\u2019s identity will be verified by microcontroller which is connected to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) database. For added security One Time Password (OTP) is also sent to user\u2019s registered mobile number which needs to be entered in the system. If user is found to be authentic then monthly quota of the ration available for the user is displayed. After successful transaction the database will be updated stating the ration content delivered to the user. This system will require very less human efforts for operation and is also very secure. By implementing this system government can keep track of all the delivered ration content very easily.

This right allows Kenyans to apply for birth certificates, national identification documents and passports. These identification documents are crucial in proving that a person has a genuine link with Kenya which in turn unlocks their enjoyment of socioeconomic and political rights. Conversely, without identity documentation, a person\u2019s access to socioeconomic and political rights is limited. Consequently, one may face challenges in accessing education, adequate healthcare, opening a bank account, travelling abroad, owning property, voting and vying for political posts, among others. The Department of Civil Registration Services has the mandate of registering births and deaths, while the National Registration Bureau is tasked with providing national identification documents. Reports conducted by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) indicate that some applicants seeking civic identification documents were asked for bribes by some registration officials in order to acquire the documentation or expedite the process . Kenya has made positive strides towards combating corruption through enacting extensive domestic anti-corruption legislation and ratifying international and regional legislation on anti-corruption. This paper argues that, successful implementation and enforcement of the existing anti-corruption laws by anti-corruption agencies will play a major role in curbing bribery that is experienced while accessing identification documents in Kenya.", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://epubs.ac.za/index.php/jacl/article/download/1706/1214", "status": "HYBRID"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2050869483", "name": "Julie Lugulu"}], "references": []}, {"paperId": "4d07c5e0e82bf21e8ab9633307254feaf889f0b2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4d07c5e0e82bf21e8ab9633307254feaf889f0b2", "title": "P\u2010hacking can be avoided with core outcome sets: preterm birth research is ready to take this leap", "abstract": "The article by Thornton et al. establishes with data from progestogen trials something that we have always feared, i.e. the corruption of reported results through selective publication of outcomes. In their analysis, trials with a predefined primary outcome showed no effect of progesterone consistently; trials that did not report a predefined primary outcome, however, had a tendency to show more promising results. Indeed, this problem is so ingrained that even prospective registration of trials has not fully addressed it. The 93 trials identified by Thornton et al. together reported 1804 outcomes. This is not only an issue in interpretation of individual trials but also a key issue hampering evidence syntheses, as outcomes often do not overlap across the literature. We can speculate why there is an obsession with achieving significance in P-values of single outcomes, but perhaps it is better to think about solutions. Moving away from estimation of statistical errors to greater use of confidence intervals has been proposed as a possible way to rid research of the tyranny of power (Bland, BMJ 2009;339:b3985). But an even better way to look at this issue is to remove the focus from reliance on a single outcome measure for determining the effect of interventions. Welcome core outcome sets (COS)! A COS is a minimal set of outcomes that relevant stakeholders consider critical to evaluate interventions for specific health conditions. In 2016 a COS for studies on prevention of preterm birth was published (van\u2018t Hooft et al. Obstet Gynecol 2016;127;49\u201358). Five different stakeholder groups (patients, midwives, neonatologists, gynaecologists and researchers) from 25 low-, middleand high-income countries came to consensus on the use of 13 (four maternal and nine neonatal) outcomes. This core outcome set is now endorsed by the CROWN initiative and adopted by 11 current trials evaluating interventions on preterm birth, like progesterone, pessary and cerclage. When funders insist that triallists collect these data uniformly, researchers commit to creating harmony in outcomes secure in the knowledge that editors will not penalise them, and readers insist on seeing them in journals, hopefully the temptation for P-hacking will be less. More importantly, progress in this direction will increase the availability of comparable data improving the quality and relevance of research syntheses, with the real prospect of impacting on care through clinical trials.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1471-0528.14647", "status": "BRONZE"}, "publicationTypes": ["LettersAndComments", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-06-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "66118203", "name": "J.

Bureaucratic reform is related to efforts to create innovation. Along with the birth of the bureaucratic reform policy, innovation was also born. Bureaucratic reform is based on Presidential Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 81 of 2010 concerning the Grand Design of Bureaucratic Reform 2010-2025, which mandates that a bureaucratic reform road map be prepared every 5 years in each Ministry/State/Government Agency. To implement the mandate of bureaucratic reform, the Supreme Court, as the State institution holding the highest judicial power, launched an innovation in case registration and trial electronically, namely the e-Court (electronic Court) application by utilizing the sophistication of technology, information, and internet networks. E-Court can be interpreted as an application used to process lawsuit or petition registration, electronic case payments, and electronic trial calls. Although there are still obstacles in the implementation of the e-Court system, its presence as the latest innovation from the Supreme Court in the framework of bureaucratic reform is very appropriate because it makes the implementation of the e-Court system more efficient.

Reviewing the population policy documents in the early 1980s revealed that press criticism on corruption and local policy as the cause of heihu missed the target and the government granted the rights of collecting and using fines for encouraging officers bearing public resistance to enforce oppressive policies from the beginning. Chinese one child policy was not only limited to population management, but it also controlled population growth within borders through overseas adoption.

The model, which is based on the Ten Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Framework, focuses on the initial inputs for birth registration at the birth notification level. The approach presented in this study paves the way for the creation of decentralized, secure, transparent, and automated systems for civil registration. The application of a smart contract architecture that blends a centralized design with an on-chain and off-chain architecture is further supported by this, providing more evidence of its viability. It offers a safe verification framework for the Ghana Birth and Death Registry based on smart contract technology and can guarantee a birth notification as proof of birth certificate registration in accordance with international standards. The findings provide insight into the use of blockchain technology in public registry institutions.

Infrared thermal video has the potential to capture events in the delivery room, such as birth, cord clamping, and resuscitative interventions, while upholding the privacy of patients and healthcare providers. Objectives The objectives of this concept study were to (i) investigate the technical feasibility of using thermal video in the delivery room to detect birth and cord clamping, and (ii) evaluate the accuracy of manual real-time registrations of the time of birth and cord clamping by comparing it with the accuracy of registrations abstracted from thermal videos. Methods An observational study with data collected at Stavanger University Hospital, Norway, from September 2022 to August 2023. The time of birth and cord clamping were manually registered on a portable tablet by healthcare providers. Thermal cameras were placed in the delivery rooms and operating theatre to capture births. Videos were retrospectively reviewed to determine the time of birth and cord clamping. Results Participation consent was obtained from 306 mothers, of which 195 births occurred in delivery rooms or an operating theatre with a thermal camera installed. We excluded 12 videos in which no births occurred. Births were detectable in all 183 (100%) thermal videos evaluated. There was a median (quartiles) of 1.8 (0.7, 5.4) s deviation in the manual registrations of the times of births relative to those abstracted from thermal videos. Cord clamping was detectable in 173 of the 183 (95%) thermal videos, with a median of 18.3 (3.3, 108) s deviation in the manual registrations of the times of cord clampings relative to those abstracted from thermal videos. Conclusion Recognizing the time of birth and cord clamping from thermal videos is technically feasible and provides a method for determining when resuscitative events occur.", "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-08-14", "authors": [{"authorId": "2222779455", "name": "Vilde Kolstad"}, {"authorId": "2175862784", "name": "J.

SUMMARY ANSWER In boys, AGD correlated from infancy to 9\u2009years of age, whereas in girls, correlations were weaker, especially between infancy and later childhood. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY AGD is considered a marker for prenatal androgen action. In males, reduced AGD is associated with testicular cancer, infertility, and lower sperm count. In females, AGD is associated with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION In the Odense Child Cohort, a prospective population-based birth cohort, pregnant women were enrolled in early pregnancy. AGD and BMI were measured repeatedly in children at ages 3 and 18\u2009months, as well as at 3, 5, 7, and 9\u2009years. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS AGD was measured from the anus to the scrotum (AGDas) and to the penis (AGDap) in 1022 boys, and to the posterior fourchette and the clitoris in 887 girls repeatedly between the age of 3\u2009months to 9\u2009years. In total, 7706 assessments were made. AGD was adjusted for body weight, and SD scores (the difference between individual AGD and the mean of AGD in the population divided by SD of AGD) were calculated for each child. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of each measurement was performed to investigate whether individual AGD was stable during childhood. Short predictive values at 3\u2009months (20th percentile) to 9\u2009years were investigated using the AUC produced by the receiver operating characteristic curve. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In boys, AGD/body size-index SD score correlated significantly between infancy and 9\u2009years, strongest for AGDas (r\u2009=\u20090.540 P\u2009>\u20090.001). In girls, weaker significant correlation coefficients were found between AGD at infancy and 9\u2009years; higher correlation coefficients were found between AGD from 3 to 9\u2009years (P\u2009>\u20090.001). Short AGDas in infancy predicted short AGDas in boys aged 9\u2009years (AUC: 0.767, sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.71). The predictive values of short infant AGDap, penile width (in boys), and AGD (in girls) concerning short outcomes at 9\u2009years were low. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AGD measurements are less precisely measurable in girls compared to boys, especially in infancy, resulting in less reproducible measurements. Additionally, because AGD is shorter in girls, the same absolute measurement error is relatively more significant, potentially contributing to greater variability and lower reproducibility in girls. This may contribute to the weaker correlations in girls compared to boys. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS In boys, AGDas, relative to body size, correlated from infancy to 9\u2009years, suggesting that AGD in infancy can be considered a non-invasive marker of later reproductive health. Further follow-up studies are needed to evaluate long-term individual tracking of AGD as well as assessment of childhood AGD as early marker of adult reproductive health.

This is partly due to improved laboratory techniques, but may also be caused by a more physiological hormonal and endometrial environment in FET cycles. Furthermore, the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is practically eliminated in segmentation cycles followed by FET and the use of natural cycles in FETs may be beneficial for the postimplantational conditions of fetal development. However, a freeze-all strategy is not yet implemented as standard care due to limitations of large randomised trials showing a benefit of such a strategy. Thus, there is a need to test the concept against standard care in a randomised controlled design. This study aims to compare ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates between a freeze-all strategy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist triggering versus human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger and fresh embryo transfer in a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Methods and analysis Multicentre randomised, controlled, double-blinded trial of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment including 424 normo-ovulatory women aged 18\u201339 years from Denmark and Sweden. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to either (1) GnRH agonist trigger and single vitrified-warmed blastocyst transfer in a subsequent hCG triggered natural menstrual cycle or (2) hCG trigger and single blastocyst transfer in the fresh (stimulated) cycle. The primary endpoint is to compare ongoing pregnancy rates per randomised patient in the two treatment groups after the first single blastocyst transfer. Ethics and dissemination The study will be performed in accordance with the ethical principles in the Helsinki Declaration. The study is approved by the Scientific Ethical Committees in Denmark and Sweden. The results of the study will be publically disseminated.

Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax Reform", "abstract": "This paper provides quasi-experimental evidence on the effects of income taxes on gross hourly wages by utilizing administrative data and a tax reform in Denmark. The reform introduced joint taxation to a middle tax bracket, bringing large changes to the tax system facing married couples. Using variation in spousal income for identification, we present non-parametric graphical evidence based on a difference-in-differences design among working married males. First, we find hetero- geneous effects across income levels. For low-income workers, taxes have negative and dynamic effects on wages. Their elasticity of wages (with respect to net-of-marginal-tax rates) is close to one. For higher-income workers, the effects are small and static, with an elasticity of approximately 0.2. Second, wages respond to taxes through human capital accumulation and job changes. Finally, with smaller magnitudes than wages, daily hours worked also respond negatively to taxes, which contrasts with the prediction from a standard labor supply-and-demand model.", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pure.au.dk/portal/files/278654418/wp22_03.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "120908023", "name": "K.

Since India is one of the world's largest nations, road transportation plays a vital role in the country's economy. For any government, having fast road transit becomes essential, and toll plazas are essential to this. The most commonly used toll systems in India at the moment are the manual toll collection and FASTag systems. Toll plaza processing times rise as a result of their need for a toll collector or attendant. The Automatic Toll Collection System, or ATCS, is a tool used to automatically collect taxes. Here, radio frequency is used to help in identification. An RFID tag will be attached to a car. This tag is nothing more than an allocated unique identification number. The RTO, or traffic controlling body, will assign this. We shall keep all of his basic data and the amount he has paid in advance for the TOLL collection in line with this number. At the toll collection facility, the reader will be positioned strategically. His prepaid balance will be reduced by the tax amount each time the car passes the toll collection center. This essay discusses several automated toll collection systems that are intended to improve overall transportation efficiency, ease toll payment procedures, and lessen traffic congestion. The suggested method computes toll fees automatically by utilizing cutting-edge technology including mobile communication, GPS, and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).", "citationCount": 1, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/3/19354.pdf", "status": "HYBRID"}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-05-07", "authors": [{"authorId": "2300555856", "name": "Rohit Yadav"}, {"authorId": "2300696627", "name": "Dnyaneshwar Gange"}, {"authorId": "2300696509", "name": "Dnyanesh Dhande"}, {"authorId": "2300694438", "name": "Vishal Agre"}, {"authorId": "2300696523", "name": "Mangala Dhotre"}], "references": [{"paperId": "31bca15bd5f0ca31029e84ab22777a946dfccd44", "title": "Volume 6, Issue 4"}, {"paperId": "b7eb3788161888eb092532d0f3fa2eaf5725e3e5", "title": "Automated toll collection system using GPS and GPRS"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "Bangladesh's electronic toll collection system: opportunities and difficulties"}, {"paperId": "2e01602f8a18913e2d81269a02892ce0aa85eccc", "title": "Automated Toll Plaza System Using RFID and GSM Technology"}, {"paperId": "3c2f9ae115cc8a7297774fb795351396c4613ce7", "title": "RFID BASED AUTOMATED TOLL COLLECTION SYSTEM"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "Design and deployment of a low-cost electronic toll collection system in India by Chatto raj, Bhowmik, Roy, and Vishwakarma.

A total of 22 participants were interviewed out of 190 tourism businesses offering tours in the Sundarbans. This research has found that 28% of economic leakage occurred in the tourism system of the Sundarbans. Imported products (e.g. food and beverage, fuel), imported services (e.g. advertising, foreign payments), and other issues (e.g. outside employee salaries, training and seminars, forest fees, government taxes) have been identified as contributing factors to economic leakage.

Zimbabwe faces the problemof officially registering the births of children born out of marriage and other vulnerable children. This study explored the socioeconomic barriers hindering the Zimbabwe government birth registration of children born out of marrriage in the Harare central district of Zimbabwe. The impediments encountered by parents and guardians of children born out of marrriage have also emerged as a global human rights issue, with over 237 million children under the age of 5 without birth registration as at 7th July 2021, following the UNICEF birth registration tracking. Using qualitative phenomenology design, the study investigated livedexperiences of parents within the Harare Central district area. The participants were selected using the snowball samplingtechnique, while three key informants were purposively sampled by the researchers. The study findings indicated that there are aplethora of socio-economic challenges emanating from a deficient government registration system, more inclined to cater for theurban based population than the rural folk. Additionally, general poverty among the majority of the population played a significantrole for the majority, who could not afford transport fees to travel to registration centre among many others. Moreover, religiousand other patriarchal cultural practices hinder access to birth registration.\nHow to reference using ASWNet style:Mavuka, A., Mashiri, C. & Soko, S. (2023).

The objective of this academic work is the analysis of the transcendental actions and results that have taken place with regard to the access of women to formal education, and to answer the supposition that if a major access of woman to education affects positively the future generations in the same area Discrimination against women in education starts because of the gender differences that society has created. There exist several barriers that limit women in their participation in educational institutes, among the five more important are: feminine feticides, lack of birth registration, child marriage, young mothers and housekeeping. All these social issues shape evidence of the rejection of society towards woman and the barriers they have to face. From 1975 international organizations have created a new awareness about gender disparities and there are events taken place that shape the start of the discussion in this subject. Later, in the early beginnings of the 90\u00b4s decade the international organizations start to deliver well documented research (via statistics) which creates a new wave of international projects. The present year 2015 is where the results of three ambitious projects created in the previous period are shown: Education for All, the World Conferences on Woman and Millennium Development Goals; these three projects put emphasis to the importance of formal education of women. By the participation of international organizations a great advance was achieved in the access of woman to education, nevertheless equality has not been fully achieved in all the educational levels. Anyhow, the statistics show that the education of the women is fundamental for the development of the society since their education guarantees a better education of subsequent generations.", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "121921796", "name": "Karina Palacios Bahamonde"}], "references": []}, {"paperId": "ea7f348ed76edc850e21dc45af995d4b337a704f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea7f348ed76edc850e21dc45af995d4b337a704f", "title": "Registering the Births of Indigenous Australians in Victoria", "abstract": "Victoria stands out as having undertaken some innovative steps, both within the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages (BDM), and outside of it.
